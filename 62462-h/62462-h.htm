  <h2 class='c006'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mineral surveys are made to mark the legal boundaries of mineral deposits or ore-bearing formations on the
public domain where the boundaries are determined by lines other than the normal subdivision of the
public lands. These surveys include the usual surveying technical procedures and the examination and
documentation of various reports and certificates necessary to substantiate legal procedures.</p>

<p class='c003'>Understanding the basis for performance of mineral surveys is imperative for the United States Mineral
Surveyors as well as for those who are involved with processing mineral survey returns, those who evaluate
claim validity, and for those cadastral surveyors who are involved in retracing original mineral surveys.</p>

<p class='c009'>This <i>Guide</i> was prepared by John V. Meldrum, U.S. Mineral Surveyor (ret.) under the direction of the
Cadastral and Mapping Training Staff, Denver Service Center, Bureau of Land Management. Mr.
Meldrum’s many years of expertise in mineral surveys, and his professionalism as a mineral surveyor are
invaluable elements of its contents.</p>

<p class='c003'>In compiling the <i>Guide</i>, assistance was obtained from all of the State Offices of the BLM, and gratitude is
expressed to those cadastral survey individuals who gave of their time and advice in assisting with its
preparation. The contribution of the Cadastral Survey Staff of the California State Office is particularly
acknowledged.</p>

of Missouri were sold outright to the highest
bidder with minimum prices set from $2.50 to
$5.00 per acre. Consequently, the prospectors
and miners of California formed mining districts
to provide self-government and maintain
law and order. These districts could be as small
as a square mile, while others covered an area
several townships in size.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–2</b> The functions of a district were to provide
rules governing the size of claims, manner of
location and discovery requirements, recording
of locations, work required to hold a claim and
period of absence constituting abandonment.</p>

<p class='c003'>The miners were not without precedents in
establishing their rules. In Europe the Germanic
or Prussian laws provided for the
discovery and location of mineral deposits with
royalties going to the crown and the surface
owner. The discoverer received a larger claim
than subsequent locators. Periods of idleness
without cause would open the ground to relocation.
A court system was provided for the
mining industry.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Prussian law was the basis for English
law and subsequently Spanish and Mexican
law. The Mexican law provided that three
claims went to the discoverer of a vein in a new
district and two claims to the discoverer of a new
vein in an old district. Claims were 200 varas
long and up to 200 varas wide, depending on dip,
a vara being about a yard. Provision was also
made for discovery work and periodic labor.</p>

<p class='c003'>As the first claims in California were for
placer gold, the miners were allowed a claim
about 10 feet along the stream and as far back as
the deposit ran. When lodes were discovered, the
discoverer was usually allowed two claims 100
feet long along the vein and 50 feet wide; then
others could stake one claim of this size on the
vein. The miner could follow his vein to depth,
establishing extralateral rights. Rules were
made for marking the boundaries of claims and
for recording them with the district recorder.
Miner’s courts were held to settle disputes. Thus,
American Mining Law was born.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–3</b> Today, the mining districts exist in name
only. As county governments were set up
(recording districts in Alaska which has no
counties), the mining districts turned their
records over to the county recorders and left the
making and enforcement of local mining laws to
state or county governments.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mining districts may still be formed but any
regulations that they may impose cannot be in
conflict with existing law at any level of
government. At this writing, none are known to
exist; however, many location certificate forms
call for a mining district, as well as the various
forms provided by the Bureau of Land Management
for the processing of mineral surveys and
patents.</p>

<p class='c003'>Each state office, except Montana, maintains
a map, chart or index of mining districts
although the boundaries may be vague and
overlapping. These records are available to the
public so that they may use a district name, if
available.</p>

<p class='c003'>If a claim is located in an area where no
district exists, it is customary to state that there
is no organized district or that the claim is in an
unorganized mining district. There is, however,
no objection to using a commonplace name as a
district to aid in identification of the claim.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Federal Mining Laws (Title 30, United States Code)</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>1–4</b> Act of February 27, 1865, Sec. 9 (13 Stat.
441): Recognized that the public domain was
being appropriated for mining purposes but that
such appropriation was by the law of possession
and that the paramount title to such lands lay in
the United States.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–5</b> Act of July 26, 1866 (14 Stat. 251):
Declared the mineral lands of the public domain
open to exploration and occupation by citizens
of the United States or those who had declared
their intentions to become citizens. It provided
for claims 200 feet in length along the vein for
each locator, with an additional claim for the
discoverer, and an association could take up to
3000 feet in length. No width was specified, only
sufficient ground for working the claim. Extralateral
rights were granted inasmuch as the
vein could be followed to any depth, with all its
dips, angles and variations. The Act also
provided for obtaining patent (fee title) from the
United States. It also recognized local customs,
rules and mining districts, so far as they were
not in conflict with the laws of the United
States. This Act was repealed by the Act of May
10, 1872.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–6</b> Act of July 9, 1870 (16 Stat. 217; 30 U.S.C.
35): Provided for placer claims (not covered in
the Act of 1866) which included all deposits
except veins of quartz and other rock in place.
They were limited in size to 160 acres, either by
one person or an association of persons, subject
to entry and patent, and where on surveyed
lands required to conform to legal subdivisions.
This Act, with modification, is still in force.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–7</b> Act of May 10, 1872 (17 Stat. 91; 30 U.S.C.
Ch. 2; Title 43 C.F.R.): This Act contains the
General Mining Laws which, with
amendments, are still in force today. It provides
in detail for discovery, location, survey and
patent of both lode and placer claims; also mill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>sites. It requires annual labor, or assessment
work until patent. Tunnel sites for the discovery
of lodes are also provided for. The succeeding
pages of this manual will take up and explain
the various provisions of this Act, with appropriate
reference and quotations from the
Code of Federal Regulations or the U.S. Code, if
not covered in the C.F.R.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–8</b> Act of March 3, 1872 (30 U.S.C. 71–90):
Provided for the location and purchase of coal;
not a mineral subject to the general mining
laws. This Act was repealed by the Mineral
Leasing Act of 1920.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–9</b> Act of May 17, 1884 (30 U.S.C. 49a–49f):

governing placer mining claims. This Act was
repealed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–12</b> Act of January 31, 1901 (30 U.S.C. 162):
Included salt in any form under the general
mining laws subject to the provisions governing
placer mining claims, limited to one claim per

Leasing Act of 1920.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–13</b> Act of April 28, 1904 (30 U.S.C. 34): The
monuments on the ground shall constitute the
highest authority as to which lands are
patented notwithstanding a conflict with the
survey record or the calls and descriptions
recited in the patent. Also, in extending the
public land surveys, all patented mineral claims
shall be segregated from the public lands as
they are monumented on the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–14</b> Act of February 25, 1920 (30 U.S.C.
Chapter 3A): The Mineral Leasing Act removed
deposits of oil, gas, coal, potassium, sodium,
phosphate, oil shale, native asphalt, solid and
semi-solid bitumen and bituminous rock, including
oil impregnated rock or sands, and
sulphur in Louisiana and New Mexico from the
general mining laws and other laws and set up a

<p class='c003'><b>1–15</b> Act of July 31, 1947 (61 Stat. 681): The
Materials Act authorized the sale of mineral
materials if the disposal of such materials was
not otherwise expressly authorized by law.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–16</b> Act of August 13, 1954 (30 U.S.C. 521):
Provided for multiple development of mineral
deposits under the mining and mineral leasing
laws. All mining claims and mill sites located
after this date, and those prior to this date that
did not preserve their rights, do not include
leasable minerals, such minerals being subject
to exploration and development under the
Mineral Leasing Act.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–17</b> Act of July 23, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 601):
Removed common varieties of sand, stone,
gravel, pumice (except block pumice), pumicite

mining laws. Also restricted the use of the
surface of unpatented mining claims to that
portion necessary for the development and
mining of the deposit and permitted the federal
government to manage the surface and
vegetative resources.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–18</b> Act of August 11, 1955 (30 U.S.C.
Chapter 16): All lands previously withdrawn for

<p class='c003'><b>1–22</b> Act of October 21, 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1744;
43 C.F.R. 3833): All unpatented mining claims,
including lodes, placers, mill sites and tunnel
sites located prior to this date must be recorded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>with the proper state office of the Bureau of
Land Management by filing a copy of the record
of the location (or last amended) notice or
certificate, as required by state law, together
with a map showing the claim and its relation to
the public land survey or protracted grid, by
October 21, 1979; and also provide evidence of
assessment work for the preceding assessment
year, or notice of intention to hold, and
thereafter prior to December 31 of each calendar
year. Claims located after October 21, 1976 shall
be recorded within 90 days of date of location
and evidence of assessment work or notice of
intention to hold, if assessment work is not
required, filed prior to December 31 of each
calendar year after the year of location. Change
in ownership must also be recorded and
(presumably) amended location certificates. If
these recording requirements are not met, the
claims are deemed to be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–23</b> Reservations, Grants, Withdrawals
and Severance of Minerals: Indian and military
reservations, national parks and monuments
are not, as a rule, open to mineral exploration
except in special instances cited in 1–24 below.
National forests are open to mineral exploration,
location and patent, but subject to rules
and regulations of the Forest Service. National
Forest Wilderness Areas are covered in 1–24
below.</p>

<p class='c003'>Grants include the Spanish Land Grants,
Railroad Grants, and School Grants (School
Sections), most of which included the minerals.</p>

<p class='c003'>At least one Spanish Land Grant, The Sangre
de Christo Grant comprising Costilla County,
Colorado, has its own system of mineral surveys.</p>

<p class='c003'>Arizona has its own rules for locating mining
claims on state (school) lands. Indemnity grants
were made in lieu of other lands previously
appropriated, including unsurveyed school
sections appropriated in part under the mining
laws.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of
December 18, 1971 granted certain lands to the
natives in Alaska and allowed owners of claims
located prior to August 31, 1971 five years to
proceed to patent. Regulations permitted filing
an application for mineral survey to be considered
an application for patent.</p>

<p class='c003'>Withdrawals made under the authority of
the President are not subject to any form of
location. Withdrawals under the Act of June 25,
1910 (43 U.S.C. 141, as amended) are subject to
location for metalliferous minerals only. The
Act, known as the Pickett Act, authorized the
President to make withdrawals for various
purposes such as power, irrigation, classification
of lands.</p>

<p class='c003'>Withdrawals under the first form Reclamation
Act of June 17, 1902 are not subject to
mining location unless opened under the Act of
April 23, 1932. Lands withdrawn under the
second form of the Act are subject to location.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of October 21, 1976(43 U.S.C. 1714) provides
for withdrawals by the Secretary of the Interior,
either on his own motion or at the request of any
department or agency head, with certain restrictions
and limitations. Each withdrawal and
subsequent restoration must be reviewed to
determine if mining locations are allowed, and
under what conditions.</p>

<p class='c003'>Severance occurs when minerals are reserved
to the United States in a patent. Some of the
Spanish Land Grants reserved certain minerals
such as gold, silver, quicksilver and antimony.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Act of March 3, 1891 reserved minerals
from townsite entries on mineral land, but each
patent should be checked; some of the early
patents reserved only “known lodes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The Act of July 17, 1914 permitted
agricultural entry or purchase of lands
withdrawn for phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil,
gas or asphalt with a reservation of these
minerals to the United States.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Act of July 20, 1956 permitted the
disposition of these minerals discovered and
located prior to the Mineral Leasing Act.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Stockraising Homestead Act of December
29, 1916 allowed entry of 320 acres rather than
the 160 acre preemption homestead, but reserved
the minerals to the United States, the
minerals being subject to disposal under the
general mining and mineral leasing laws. The
surface owner is protected by the Act, and a
bond must be posted with the Bureau of Land
Management unless satisfactory arrangements
can be made between the mineral and surface
owner (43 C.F.R. 3814).</p>

<p class='c003'>Lands patented under the Color of Title Act
(43 U.S.C. 1068), by exchange under the Taylor
Grazing Act (43 U.S.C. 315g) and by Forest
Exchanges (16 U.S.C. 485) with mineral reservation
to the United States, are subject to appropriation
under the mining and mineral
leasing laws.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The Atomic Energy Act of August 1, 1946
reserved fissionable source material, uranium
and thorium, to the United States, but these
provisions have since been rescinded and such
minerals are locatable under the mining laws.
Mining claims for fissionable source materials
could be located on lands known to be valuable
for coal under the Act of August 11, 1955 (30
U.S.C. 541 through 541i) which expired August
11, 1975.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–24</b> Areas Subject to Special Mining Laws:</p>

<p class='c003'>O &amp; C Lands: The Act of April 8, 1948 (62
Stat. 162) reopened the revested Oregon and
California Railroad and Reconveyed Coos Bay
Wagon Road Grant Lands to exploration,
location, entry and disposition under the United
States Mining Laws, but imposed additional
requirements regarding the filing of location
certificates, affidavits of annual labor, use of
timber, etc. See 43 C.F.R. 3821 for details.</p>

<p class='c003'>Alaska Public Sale Act of August 30, 1949 (48
U.S.C. 364a–364e) segregated for classification
and sale certain lands, but reserved the
minerals for disposition under applicable law.
Provided compensation to the surface owner for
damage. See 43 C.F.R. 3822.</p>

<p class='c003'>National Forest Wilderness Areas are open to
prospecting and mining under existing laws
until midnight, December 31, 1983 by which
time they shall be closed except for valid
existing rights. Patents will be for mineral only
with title to the surface reserved to the United
States, subject to certain use to facilitate
mining. See 43 C.F.R. 3823.</p>

<p class='c003'>City of Prescott, Arizona Watershed: The Act
of January 19, 1933 (16 U.S.C. 482a) restricted
future mining locations to minerals only with
restricted use of the surface. See C.F.R. 3824.</p>

<p class='c003'>Papago Indian Reservation, Arizona: The Act
of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461–479) as amended,
restores from temporary withdrawal mineral
location and entry under the United States
Mining Laws, but imposes additional requirements
for recording locations with the
superintendent of the reservation, payment of
annual rental to the tribe and a fee in lieu of the
annual rental at time of patent. See 43 C.F.R.
3825.</p>

<p class='c003'>National Park Service Areas: National parks
and national monuments are, as a general rule,
closed to mining, but there are exceptions,
subject to special rules, regulations, and reservations
in the patent. These special areas are:
Mt. McKinley National Park, Alaska (see 43
C.F.R. 3826.1); Olympic National Park,
Washington (see 43 C.F.R. 3826.2); Death Valley
National Monument, California (see 43 C.F.R.

Alaska (see 43 C.F.R. 3826.4); Organ Pipe
Cactus National Monument, Arizona (see 43
C.F.R. 3826.5). The Act of September 28, 1976 (90
Stat. 1342, 16 U.S.C. 1901) prohibits further
mining locations in these national parks and
monuments.</p>

<p class='c003'>King Range National Conservation Area,
California: Mining claims are not prohibited,
but those located after October 21, 1970 are
subject to strict regulations and inspection of all
mining activity (see 43 C.F.R. 3827).</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–25</b> Acquired Lands: Minerals on acquired
lands are not generally open to mineral entry.
These minerals are possibly subject to leasing
only (see 43 C.F.R. 3500).</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–26</b> Update: In order that mineral surveyors
may keep abreast of new laws it is
desirable that the Office of Chief, Division of
Cadastral Survey, Washington, D.C. keep the
mineral surveyors advised, furnishing copies of
the Acts and pertinent regulations, so far as it is
practicable to do so. Mineral surveyors may also
keep abreast of new legislation through the local
offices of the BLM, their congressmen and by
becoming members of local mining associations
and attending their meetings.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>State Mining Laws</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>1–27</b> Both the Acts of 1866 and 1872 provided
for recognition of “<i>local customs or rules of
miners</i> in the several mining districts so far as
the same are applicable and not inconsistent
with the laws of the United States.”</p>

<p class='c003'>(R.S. 2319, 30 U.S.C. 22). C.F.R. 3831.1 states
in part “(c) <i>complying with</i> the <i>State Laws</i>,
regarding the recording of the location in the
county recorder’s office, discovery work, etc. As
supplemental to the United States mining laws
there are <i>State statutes</i> relative to location,
manner of recording of mining claims, etc., in
the State, which should also be observed in the
location of mining claims.”</p>

<p class='c003'>43 C.F.R. 3841.4–2 states in part: “... 600
feet in width, but whether surface ground of that
width can be taken depends upon the local
regulations of <i>State or Territorial laws</i> in force&nbsp;....” and 43 C.F.R. 3841.4–6 “the location
notice must be filed for record in all respects as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>required by the <i>State or Territorial laws</i>, and
local rules and regulations if there be any.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Requirements of State law as to mining
locations must be complied with if they are not
repugnant to the United States mining laws.
South Dakota v. Madill, 53 I.D. 195 (1930).</p>

<p class='c003'>It is very clear that State laws must be
complied with and some states go so far as to
state that if the essentials of discovery and
location are not complied with, the claim shall
be null and void. Also, location certificates that
do not contain the information set forth in the
law, including an adequate description, shall be
void.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mineral surveyors cannot ignore state
law, yet there are areas where they should not
force the claimant to comply, such as failure to
do the necessary discovery work as long as a
discovery point has been designated. In such
cases the claimant should be advised of the
apparent discrepancy. At his insistence, the
survey should be executed and processed to
show the facts and conditions as they exist,
leaving the matter to adjudication during
patent proceedings. On the other hand, an
inadequate description in the location certificate
is justification for requiring an amended
certificate.</p>

<p class='c003'>Each mineral surveyor should obtain a copy
of the state mining laws as soon as possible after
receiving an order for survey in that state. The
Chief, Branch of Cadastral Survey of each state
office should have an up-to-date copy of the laws
for his state, and advise the Chief, Division of
Cadastral Survey at Washington, D.C. of
changes as they occur so that he may keep all
mineral surveyors advised.</p>

<p class='c003'>Copies of state laws, in pamphlet form, are
usually available from the State Bureau of
Mines or Geological Survey, the Secretary of
State or Attorney General.</p>

<p class='c003'>Do not confuse state laws pertaining to the
location of mining claims on the public domain
with state laws covering the location of state
lands. Arizona, for instance, allows the staking
of mining claims on state lands and publishes
rules and regulations governing such appropriation.
Most states, however, lease their
minerals.</p>

<p class='c003'>Following is an abstract of the state laws in
force so that mineral surveyors and cadastral
surveyors will have an immediate source of
information. The abstract is by no means
complete, but contains only the essentials, and
is not a substitute for the laws themselves.</p>

<h5 class='c013'>Survey-Legal Interrelationships</h5>

<p class='c012'><b>1–47</b> The mineral surveyor and the cadastral
surveyor responsible for processing mineral
surveys must be thoroughly familiar with both
federal and state law relating to the appropriation
of minerals on the public domain.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mineral surveyor may be the first detailed
contact of the claimant with a government
official, and he will look to the mineral surveyor
for guidance through the first steps to obtaining
patent, i.e., the survey, including discovery and
work requirements.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the location does not meet the requirements
set forth in the law, the mineral surveyor may
suggest the corrective steps necessary, including
an amended location. If the location
certificate is too vague, an amended certificate
will be in order. If the development work
includes improvements that will not count as
patent expenditure or if common improvements
will not meet the tests set forth in the chapter on
mineral surveys in the <cite>Manual of Surveying
Instructions</cite>, the mineral surveyor should
discuss the matter with the claimant and
suggest corrective measures.</p>

<p class='c003'>The matter of a valid discovery or what
constitutes sufficient mineral for patent is a
complicated matter. While the mineral surveyor
may discuss the subject in generalities, as set
forth in the next chapter, it is not his duty to rule
on it, this being a matter for the mineral
examiner and adjudicators to determine. He
may guide the claimant in properly locating and
surveying his claims for patent.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the mineral surveyor feels that the claimant
is not justified in proceeding to patent or if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>feels that the land is being obtained for purposes
other than mining, he may decline to make the
survey, since it is a matter of private contract.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–48</b> Relationship of surveyor and attorney:
If the claimant has employed an attorney-at-law,
the surveyor and attorney should work
closely together.</p>

<p class='c003'>The surveyor should recognize that he is not
schooled in the law and should respect the
attorney’s opinion; on legal matters it is the
attorney’s responsibility.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the other hand, the attorney is not
schooled in surveying and the surveyor should
guide him in technical matters. The surveyor
may refuse to comply with requests that are in
conflict with his requirements of survey and
that of the Bureau of Land Management.
Doubtful situations may be referred to the
Bureau of Land Management for further instructions.</p>

<p class='c003'>Many attorneys are not expert in mining law
and may require guidance from the mineral
surveyor. Should the surveyor find himself in a
situation where legal advice is necessary, and
the claimant has not employed an attorney, he
should discuss the matter with the claimant and
recommend obtaining the services of a lawyer.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>1–49</b> Extralateral Rights (Apex): Both the
Acts of 1866 and 1872 granted the right to follow
a vein downward on its dip beyond the vertical
boundaries of the claim. R.S. 2322, 30 U.S.C. 26
states in part:</p>

<p class='c014'>“The locators of all mining
locations made on any mineral vein,
lode or ledge situated on the public
domain&nbsp;... shall have the exclusive
right of possession and enjoyment&nbsp;... of
all veins, lodes,
and ledges throughout their entire
depth, the top or apex of which lies
inside of such surface lines extended
downward vertically, although such
veins, lodes or ledges may so far
depart from a perpendicular in their
course downward as to extend outside
the vertical side lines of such
surface locations. But their right to
possession to such outside parts of
such veins or ledges shall be confined
to such portions thereof as lie
between vertical planes drawn
downward as above described,
through the end lines of their
locations, so continued in their own
direction that such planes will intersect
such exterior parts of such
veins or lodes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Extralateral rights exist only when the end
lines are substantially parallel and then only
when the apex of the vein passes through at
least one of the end lines.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the vein passes through both end lines it
may be followed with all its dips and variations
beyond the side lines within the vertical planes
of the end lines (see Claim A of Figure 1).</p>

<p class='c003'>Where the vein passes through one end line
and one side line, one end line is theoretically
moved by protraction to the point where the vein
leaves the side line, and extralateral rights
apply on the vein only to the extent of the
foreshortened claim (see Claim B of Figure 1).</p>

<p class='c003'>Where the vein leaves the claim through both
side lines, there are no extralateral rights and
the vein may be mined only in the area
contained within the vertical boundaries of the
claim (see Claim C of Figure 1).</p>

<p class='c003'>Two claims might be located along the strike
of the same vein in such a manner as to produce
diverging end lines as in Claims D and E of
Figure 1. In this case a portion of the vein
beneath the surface (F) belongs to neither claim
and must be appropriated by staking claims the
vertical boundaries of which will encompass the
unappropriated segment.</p>

<p class='c003'>Where veins of two different claims unite on
the dip, the portion below the junction belongs to
the senior claim; if the veins cross, rather than
unite, the junction belongs to the senior claim.</p>

<p class='c003'>An outcrop is not an apex in the case of bedded
deposits that are tilted or outcrop on a canyon
wall. Claims located on the outcrops of bedded
deposits have no extralateral rights.</p>

<p class='c003'>Where the vein is wider than patent, the
extralateral rights belong to the senior claim. A
claim located on the dip, though senior, loses the
vein to a junior claim properly located on the
apex. The latter issues have been the subject of
numerous lawsuits, and there have been
decisions favoring each side.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Figure 1, Claims A, B, C, D and E were
located along the apex of a vein dipping to the
south in alphabetical order, “A” being the oldest
claim. The portions of the vein belonging to each
claim are shown by various cross-hatching.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span><b>1–50</b> Riparian Rights: Although not a
general rule, occasions have arisen when a
mining claim adjoins a navigable body of water
and the shoreline or mean high water mark
becomes the boundary of the claim. In such
instances it is proper to run such a boundary as
a meander line and the field notes of the mineral
survey should state that it is a meander line of
the mean high water line and that the corners of
such line are meander corners. The situation is
well stated in <cite>Alaska United Gold Mining Co. et
al. <span class='fixed'>v.</span> Cincinnati-Alaska Mining Co. et al.</cite>,
decided April 18, 1916, 45 L.D. 330:</p>

<p class='c014'>“The rule as to meander lines is
applicable to mining claims, and
where in the course of an official
patent survey of a mining claim
abutting upon a navigable body of
water a meander line has been run,
which follows as nearly as practicable
the shore line of the water,
such shore line and not the meander
line, must be taken as the boundary
of the claim when patented according
to the plat and field notes of the
survey.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where one of the boundaries of a
patented mining claim is a
navigable body of water, all accretions
formed after survey and
prior to entry and patent of the tract
passed under the patent, and all
accretions that may thereafter form,
become the property of the riparian
proprietor.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Following is an example of a mining claim
with a meander line as a boundary taken from
Mineral Survey 2154A Alaska. While the notes
do not specifically call for meander corners, they
do state that the line follows the mean high
water mark of Cook Inlet (Figure 2). It is not
necessary to monument the intermediate angle
points along the meander line, as the example
shows.</p>

<p class='c003'>Should one entire end of a claim be delineated
by a meander line, the end line will be protracted
parallel to the inland end line at the farthest
seaward point for the purpose of determining
extralateral rights.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c011'>Lode Claims</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>2–1</b> Discovery: “No lode claim shall be
located until after the discovery of a vein or lode
within the limits of the claim, the object of which
provision is evidently to prevent the appropriation
of presumed mineral ground for speculative
purposes to the exclusion of bona fide prospectors,
before sufficient work has been done to
determine whether a vein or lode really exists.”
(43 C.F.R. 3841.3–1) Obviously, then, the staking
and recording of a claim without a discovery
of mineral is to no avail, except that a discovery
made prior to intervening rights perfects the
location. A claimant diligently trying to make a
discovery will generally be protected.</p>

<p class='c003'>Except for the minerals covered by the
Leasing Act (1920), and common varieties
which may be acquired under the Materials Act
(1947 and 1955), “Whatever is recognized as a
mineral by the standard authorities, whether
metallic or other substance, when found on
public lands in quantity and quality sufficient
to render the lands valuable on account thereof,
is treated as coming within the purview of the
mining laws.” (43 C.F.R. 3812.1)</p>

<p class='c003'>Whether a mineral should be located as a lode
or placer claim depends on the nature of the
deposit.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lodes are deposits of mineral in place,
regardless of their origin. The mineral must be
firmly contained or embraced in solid rock. This
includes veins with distinct hanging and foot
walls, replacement deposits in sedimentary
formations, ancient stream channels now
consolidated in sandstones, such as the
uranium deposits of Wyoming, and disseminated
deposits such as the copper
porphyries of Arizona.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the other hand, mechanical deposits of
minerals such as gold contained in the gravels
of stream beds and alluvium deposits are
properly located as placer claims. However,
certain rock types, such as marble and perlite
while mineral in place, are properly located as
placers since the Act of 1892 provided for
locating building stone under the placer mining
laws. Included are bedded minerals not contained
in rock in place, such as bentonite.</p>

<p class='c003'>The discovery requirements for a lode claim
are that the mineral must be in place. A
discovery of float (a loose piece of ore from a
vein) is insufficient. Merely a trace of mineral is
insufficient. Discovery by geologic inference is
insufficient. There must be an actual and
physical exposure of a lode.</p>

<p class='c003'>The discovery must be on vacant public
domain, which includes patented surface lands
with minerals reserved to the United States.</p>

<p class='c003'>There have been many court cases and
decisions as to what constitutes the discovery of
a valuable mineral deposit and it can be a
difficult and complicated matter. The general
rule is stated in the famous <i>Castle</i> v. <i>Womble</i>
Decision, 19 L.D. 455, 1894: “When minerals
have been found and the evidence is of such a
character that a person of ordinary prudence
would be justified in the further expenditure of
his labor and means, with a reasonable prospect
of success, in developing a valuable mine, the
requirements of the statute have been met.”</p>

<p class='c003'>In the Jefferson-Montana Copper Mines Co.
case, 41 L.D. 320, 1902, it was stated that the
following elements of discovery are necessary:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>“1.</dt>
    <dd>There must be a vein or lode of quartz or other rock in place.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>The quartz or other rock in place must carry gold or some other valuable mineral deposit.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>The two preceding elements, when taken together, must be such as to warrant a
    <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>prudent man in the expenditure of his time and money in the effort to develop a
    valuable mine.”
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c003'>The extent of discovery will vary with the
situation to be considered and the type of
mineral and deposit. For example, the requirement
as between two claimants is far less than
that between a claimant and the United States.
A mineral of intrinsic value such as gold may
well be considered under the rules set forth
above, but a more common mineral would be
further subjected to a test of marketability.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the course of patent proceedings, a mineral
examiner of the Bureau of Land Management,
the Forest Service if the claim is in a national
forest or the National Park Service if the claim is
in a national park or monument, will make a
field investigation to determine the validity of
the claims in question.</p>

<p class='c003'>Each location must be shown to be more
valuable for minerals than for any other
purpose and the burden of proof rests with the
claimant. The claimant must be prepared to
show the actual physical discovery and substantiate
the value through assays, drill logs,
etc.</p>

<p class='c003'>The discovery need not be on the surface and
may be made underground. In the case of
blanket (horizontal) veins, the vein may be
wider than the claim and discovery can be made
anywhere within its boundaries. A discovery
showing value and/or marketability may be
anywhere within the claim. The discovery may
be on the end line of a claim, but a single
discovery cannot support more than one claim.</p>

<p class='c003'>A discovery may be lost by the patenting of a
junior claim in conflict, in which case a new
discovery is required.</p>

<p class='c003'>A claim cut in two by a non-mineral patent
requires a discovery on each portion of the
claim.</p>

<p class='c003'>A claimant is entitled to possession as against
third parties as long as he is diligently engaged
in trying to make a discovery.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>2–2</b> Discovery Work: 43 C.F.R. 3841.3–2
states:</p>

<p class='c014'>“The claimant should, therefore,
prior to locating his claim, unless the
vein can be traced upon the surface,
sink a shaft or run a tunnel or drift to
a sufficient depth therein to discovery
and develop a mineral-bearing
vein, lode or crevice; should
determine, if possible, the general
course of such vein in either direction
from the point of discovery, by which
direction he will be governed in
marking the boundaries of his claim
on the surface.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Except for the foregoing, the matter of
discovery work is left to State law. The general
requirement was that the vein (deposit) be
disclosed to a depth of ten feet, or deeper if
necessary, in a shaft, cut or tunnel. In recent
years the tendency is away from requiring
discovery work. This was brought about largely
through the destruction of the surface by
bulldozers digging needless pits or cuts on
uranium claims in order to satisfy State law.</p>

<p class='c003'>Drill holes have also been substituted for the
usual shaft, cut or tunnel. In some cases the
filing of maps has been substituted for discovery
work.</p>

<p class='c003'>The statutory requirements for each State are
given in Chapter I. This chapter and the
statutes themselves should be checked for
current requirements.</p>

<p class='c003'>In any event, a discovery point (usually
marked by a discovery monument, bearing a
notice) should be selected by the claimant from
which to recite the dimensions of his claim. If a
discovery is made underground, the discovery
work requirement is usually met by driving a
drift or raise, or sinking a winze on the vein, for
ten feet in length; the discovery point is then
marked on the surface, with the dip of the vein, if
any, projected to the surface.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>2–3</b> Location: 43 C.F.R. 3841.4–1 states:
“From and after May 10, 1872, any person&nbsp;...
may locate&nbsp;... a mining claim 1,500 linear feet
along the&nbsp;... vein&nbsp;...; or an association of
persons&nbsp;... may make joint location of such
claim of 1,500 feet, but in no event can a location
of a vein or lode made after May 10, 1872, exceed
1,500 feet along the course thereof....”</p>

<p class='c003'>43 C.F.R. 3841.4–2 states: “No lode located
after May 10, 1872 can exceed a parallelogram
1,500 feet in length by 600 feet in width, but
whether surface ground of that width can be
taken depends upon the local regulations or
State or Territorial laws.... No such local
regulations or State or Territorial laws shall
limit a vein or lode claim to less than 1,500 feet&nbsp;... nor can surface rights be limited to less than
50 feet in width....”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>43 C.F.R. 3841.4–3 further states: “With
regard to the extent of surface ground&nbsp;..., the
Act of May 10, 1872, provides that the lateral
extent of locations of veins or lodes&nbsp;... shall in
no case exceed 300 feet on each side of the middle
of the vein at the surface, and that no such
surface rights shall be limited by any mining
regulations to less than 25 feet on each side of
the middle of the vein at the surface&nbsp;...; the end
lines of such claims to be in all cases parallel to
each other&nbsp;...; and when the locator does not
determine by exploration where the middle of
the vein at the surface is, his discovery shaft
must be assumed to mark such point.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The only State known to limit the width of
claims at present is North Dakota which only
allows 150 feet on each side of the vein.</p>

<p class='c003'>While Wyoming allows the full width, the side
lines must be equidistant from the discovery,
i.e., a claim may not have 300 feet on one side
and 200 feet on the other. Since the federal law
limits the size to 300 feet on each side of the vein,
if 200 feet is taken on one side, 400 cannot be
taken on the other.</p>

<p class='c003'>The length each way from the point of
discovery may be any amount as long as the
total does not exceed 1,500 feet.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is no limit to the number of claims any
individual, association or corporation may
locate.</p>

<p class='c003'>Figure 3 shows three different claim patterns,
all of which meet federal requirements. Claim A
is the usual rectangle with the full length and
width, Claim B shows parallel end lines that are
not at right angles to the lode line and side lines.
While they are longer than 600 feet, the right
angle distance on either side of the lode line is
exactly 300 feet.</p>

<p class='c003'>Claim C shows a break in bearing of the lode
line at the center of the claim (it could be
anywhere on the lode line). Like Claim B, the
right angle width does not exceed 300 feet on
either side of the center line for any portion of
the claim.</p>

<p class='c003'>Corners may be placed on patented land and
on other claims in order to obtain the described
pattern and achieve parallel end lines with
extralateral rights. If the fee owner objects to
monuments, witness corners may be used.</p>

<p class='c003'>43 C.F.R. 3841.4–4 and 3841.4–5 give the
minimum requirements for defining and
monumenting locations including the recording
of location notices. The laws of the various
states elaborate on these requirements giving
minimum size of monuments and acceptable
materials, specifying the points on the boundaries
that shall be monumented, giving the
contents required in the location certificates and
setting time limits for completing discovery
work and recording. (See Chapter I.)</p>

<p class='c003'>A wood 4″×4″ post at least four feet in length,
well set in the ground, makes a good monument.
It should be marked on the side facing the claim
with the corner number and initial, if not the full
name of the claim. Side centers may be marked
S/C and end corners E/C, as required.</p>

<p class='c003'>Discovery monuments are usually marked
D.M. The markings can be painted, or scribed
with a timber scriber. In a very active area
where a number of claims are being staked,
claimants often paint the tops of posts with a
distinctive color so that they may be readily
identified.</p>

<p class='c003'>A simple way to lay out and monument a
single claim is to begin at the discovery point
and run out the desired distance each way along
the lode line, then turn an angle of 90° and run
each way 300 feet to the corners. (See Figure 4.)</p>

<p class='c003'>A simple way to lay out a block of claims on a
bedded deposit is to run out a common set of end
lines and at 300 feet or less turn 90° and at 50 feet
or less set a discovery monument. Continue this
procedure until the end of the area is reached,
then complete the survey by running the
boundaries so that each corner is located and
monumented. (See Figure 4.)</p>

<p class='c003'>In staking a block of claims it is advisable to
make them short of the 600′×1500′ so that minor
errors in the location survey will not result in
infractions caused by oversize claims.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is no set rule for numbering corners,
clockwise or counterclockwise, except that they
be consecutive. In a block of claims corner
numbers should be grouped, reducing the
number of ties to a section corner or natural
object.</p>

<p class='c003'>While 43 C.F.R. 3841.4–5 calls for a tie to a
permanent, well-known point or object from the
discovery, a tie from one of the corners is
perfectly acceptable. In fact a metes and bounds
description with bearings given at least to
degrees and distances in feet, should be included
in the location certificate. Avoid using such
directions as southwesterly, northeasterly,
northerly, etc. Acceptable location certificate
forms can usually be purchased at a local
printer or stationery store.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>The term “location notice” applies to the
notice posted on the claim at the time of
discovery. Some states require that a copy of
this notice be recorded, while others provide for
the filing of a location certificate after all
discovery work has been completed and the
boundaries monumented. Forms for the location
notice, to be followed by the location certificate
for Colorado, and a form for a California
location notice, where a copy of the notice is
recorded, are included in the appendix.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Placer Claims</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>2–4</b> Discovery: 43 C.F.R. 3842.1–1 states:
“But one discovery of mineral is required to
support a placer location, whether it be of 20
acres by an individual, or 160 acres or less by an
association of persons.” The discovery may be
anywhere in the claim and must be more than a
trace. Although it need not be commercial for
purposes of location, commercial feasibility (or
marketability) will be required for patent.</p>

<p class='c003'>Known lodes are automatically excluded from
placer locations. If any are known to exist they
must be located as lode claims; the extent of
surface ground may be the minimum, i.e., 25 ft.
on either side of the vein.</p>

<p class='c003'>A number of oil shale placer claims were in
existence at the time the Mineral Leasing Act
was passed in 1920, and have subsequently been
patented. Many discontinued performing the
annual assessment work on the theory that no
one else could locate the claim. The Department
of the Interior has recently ruled (U.S. v. Frank
W. Winnegar et al.; 81 I.D. 370) that failure to
develop an oil shale claim demonstrates that the
deposit is not valuable and that the rule of the
prudent man has not been met.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>2–5</b> Discovery Work: As with lodes, the
State requirements for discovery work have
been eliminated for all but the State of
Washington. However, sufficient excavation
will be necessary to disclose a valuable deposit.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>2–6</b> Location: The Act of 1870 limited placer
claims to 160 acres, whether they be located by
an individual or association; the Act of 1872
limited locations to 20 acres per person, with up
to 160 acres for an association of eight persons.
Therefore, two persons may take 40 acres; three
take 60 acres; four take 80 acres, etc.</p>

<p class='c003'>If practicable, placer claims shall conform to
the legal subdivisions of the public land survey,
with ten acres being the smallest unit considered.
If on unsurveyed lands, a placer claim
should conform to the protracted survey. If on
surveyed lands, no further description is
necessary and the claim may proceed to patent
on this basis. State law may require monumentation
of the corners.</p>

<p class='c003'>If on unsurveyed lands a mineral survey will
be required before application for patent can be
made. Further limitation on size of precious
metal placers is imposed by the State of Alaska.
There is no limit on the number of placer claims
that may be located.</p>

<p class='c003'>Where fractional lots of the public land survey
are encountered, the rule of approximation may
be applied to excess acreage. The rule is that the
amount of excess may not exceed the amount of
loss, if one of the subdivisions were eliminated.
On the basis of ten acre tracts, the allowable
excess would be 4.99 acres.</p>

<p class='c003'>There are instances where conformity to the
public land survey is not practical. These
instances occur where conformity would take in
a sizable amount of non-mineral ground, such
as a gulch placer, where the claim is surrounded
by prior locations or conformity would
necessitate placing the lines on prior claims. In
these cases, a metes and bounds description is
proper, but with the following limitation: A
location by one or two persons must be included
within a square 40 acre tract; a location by three
or four persons within two square 40 acre tracts
placed end to end; a location by five or six
persons within three square 40 acre tracts;
seven or eight persons within four square 40
acre tracts. (43 C.F.R. 3842.1–5)</p>

<p class='c003'>Regardless of the manner in which a placer is
described, a location notice and/or certificate
must be posted and filed for record. A sample
certificate is included in the appendix.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Mill Sites</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>2–7</b> Authority: The Act of 1872 provided for
five acre mill sites to be taken in conjunction
with lode claims or for the purpose of building
an ore reduction works (mill or smelter). The Act
of 1960 further provided for mill sites taken in
conjunction with placer claims, and further
provided for the description to be in the same
manner as the placer. This provided for describing
mill sites by legal subdivisions, and in
practice this method of description is extended
to mill sites taken with lodes or for an ore
reduction works. (Instruction Memo No. 72–151,
4/25/72.)</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Land appropriated as a mill site must be non-mineral
in character and the surface open to
location under the mining laws. Once patented,
it includes all minerals. Nominal values do not
constitute mineral ground, nor does the fact that
a mill site adjoins a lode or placer claim prove
mineral ground. In patent proceedings, the
mineral examiner may require drilling to
provide the non-mineral character of the land.</p>

<p class='c003'>As with lodes and placers, a location notice
must be posted and recorded. (See appendix for
sample.) State law may require monumentation,
even if described by legal subdivisions.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>2–8</b> Required Use: 43 C.F.R. 3844.1
states: “A omitted is required to be used or
occupied distinctly and explicitly for mining or
milling purposes in connection with the lode or
placer claim with which it is associated. A
custom or independent mill site may be located
for the erection and maintenance of a quartz
mill or reduction works.”</p>

<p class='c003'>There is no limit to the number of mill sites
that may be located, so long as they are
necessary for the operation of a mine or mill.
Acceptable uses include tailings ponds, dumps,
storage facilities, living quarters, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Tunnel Sites</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>2–9</b> Possessory Right: The Act of 1872 gave
the proprietors of a mining tunnel the
possessory right to 1,500 feet of any blind lodes
cut by the tunnel, not previously known to exist,
for a distance of 3,000 feet from the portal, or
first working face of the tunnel. Since the 1,500
feet could be taken in either direction from the
line of the tunnel, this provided an exclusive
area 3,000 feet square.</p>

<p class='c003'>When a lode is discovered in the tunnel, it
must be staked on the surface, and a notice
posted on the surface at the projected point of
discovery, either directly above or protracted on
the dip of the vein.</p>

<p class='c003'>Failure to work the tunnel for six months
constitutes abandonment. A tunnel site may not
be patented. (See appendix for sample location
certificate.)</p>

<p class='c003'><b>2–10</b> Location: 43 C.F.R. 3843.2 and 3843.3
provides for posting a notice at the portal of
the tunnel, staking the claim and recording a
copy of the notice with the proper local
authorities. The Act of 1976 also requires
recording with the Bureau of Land Management.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is customary to stake the line of the tunnel
at such intervals so that each succeeding stake
or monument is visible from the last, beginning
at the first working face and continuing 3,000
feet to the end. The four corners of the tunnel site
should also be monumented.</p>

<p class='c003'>Although not expressly provided for by law, a
dump site of reasonable size may be located at
the portal of the tunnel.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>General</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>2–11</b> Recording of Claims: 43 C.F.R.
3841.4–6 states: “The location notice must be
filed for record in all respects as required by
State or Territorial laws, and local rules and
regulations, if there be any.” Although the
foregoing is contained in that section pertaining
to lode claims, the same applies to placer claims,
mill sites and tunnel sites. All the state laws
make provision for the recording of location
notices, with the County Clerk and Recorder or
his equivalent (Register of Deeds in North and
South Dakota, County Auditor in the State of
Washington). Should the claim fall in two
counties, it is proper to record the original
certificate in the county (and state) where the
discovery lies.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976 made the recordation of mining
claims with the Bureau of Land Management
mandatory. Unlike state requirements, failure
to file for record with the Bureau of Land
Management within the designated time makes
the claim abandoned and void. The objective is
stated in 43 C.F.R. 3833.0–2:</p>

<p class='c014'>“An objective of these regulations
is to determine the number and
location of unpatented mining
claims, mill sites or tunnel sites
located on Federal lands to assist in
the management of those lands and
the mineral resources therein. Other
objectives are to remove the cloud on
the title to these lands because they
are subject to mining claims that
may have been abandoned and to
keep the BLM abreast of transfers of
interest in unpatented mining
claims, mill site and tunnel sites&nbsp;....”</p>

<p class='c003'>An abstract of the law is given in Chapter I.
The proper State office of the Bureau of Land
Management should be contacted to determine
their requirements.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><b>2–12</b> Assessment Work (Annual Labor): 43
C.F.R. 3851.1 states:</p>

<p class='c014'>“In order to hold the possessory
right to a lode or placer location
made after May 10, 1872, not less
than $100 worth of labor must be
performed or improvements made
thereon annually. The period within
which the work required to be done
shall commence at 12 o’clock meridian
on the first day of September
succeeding the date of location of
each claim. Where a number of
contiguous claims are held in common,
the aggregate expenditure that
would be necessary to hold all the
claims may be made on any one
claim. Cornering locations are held
not to be contiguous.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Almost any type of improvement will count as
assessment work. Development work in the
form of shafts, cuts and tunnels definitely will
count as well as drill holes. Roads, bridges, ore
bins, etc., will also count. Recently, geological,
geochemical and geophysical surveys have
been included as qualifying for assessment
work, although not for patent expenditure.</p>

<p class='c003'>Reports by qualified experts conducting such
surveys must be filed with the county recorder.
Such work cannot apply to more than two
consecutive years and no more than a total of
five years. Work may be done in a common
improvement, but such work must be of benefit
to all claims of the common group. It may be
outside the claims, such as a tunnel driven
toward the group for the development of the
claims at depth. Not all work qualifying for
annual labor will qualify as patent expenditure.</p>

<p class='c003'>Provision is made in state laws for the filing of
an affidavit of assessment work and form of
content is provided. A copy of said affidavit or
other proof must also be filed with the Bureau of
Land Management. In the past, the filing for
record of the affidavit shifted the burden of
proof from the claimant to third parties and
failure to file such an affidavit, or failure to do
the work, did not invalidate the claim. Now,
failure to do the work and file the necessary
proof with the Bureau of Land Management will
render the claim abandoned and void.</p>

<p class='c003'>Notice of intent to hold must be filed with the
Bureau of Land Management in the case of mill
sites and tunnel sites and in the case of lodes or
placers should the annual assessment work be
suspended as it has in the past during time of
war or economic stress.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>2–13</b> Relocation, Amended Location, Additional
Location Certificate: The terms
“relocation” and “amended location” when
made by the owner are synonymous. Generally,
there is no relocation or amended location by the
owner unless there is a change on the ground,
such as a change in the boundaries or a change
in the discovery. Such relocations or amended
locations relate back to the original location and
no existing rights are surrendered by such an
amendment. If there is no change on the ground,
and the change is only in the description, then
an additional location certificate will suffice.</p>

<p class='c003'>Amendments (or relocations) by the owner are
made for the purpose of correcting any errors in
the original location, description or record,
changing the boundaries, or for the purpose of
acquiring that part of any overlapping claim
that has been abandoned. A relocation by the
owner will not cure the lack of discovery or
failure to do assessment work.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the case of relocation of an abandoned
claim by a third party, the discovery work
should be extended or a new discovery made and
the monuments should be checked to see that all
are in place and in good condition. Such a
relocation does not relate back to the original
location.</p>

<p class='c003'>State laws cover amendments and relocations
and they should be checked for the requirements.

and Amended Location Certificate.)</p>

  <h2 class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER III</span><br /> Mineral Surveyors</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>Appointments</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>3–1</b> 43 C.F.R. 3861.5–1 states:</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pursuant to section 2334 of the
Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 39), the
Director or his delegate will appoint
only a sufficient number of surveyors
for the survey of mining
claims to meet the demand for that
class of work. Each applicant shall
qualify as prescribed by the Director
or his delegate. Applications for
appointment may be made at any
office of the Bureau of Land Management
listed in 3821.2–1 of these
regulations. A roster of appointed
mineral surveyors will be available
at these offices. Each appointee may
execute mineral surveys in any state
where mineral surveys are authorized.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The Director referred to is the Director, Bureau
of Land Management.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–2</b> Mineral Surveyors were originally appointed
by the Surveyors General (General
Land Office) of the various states where mineral
surveys are authorized, and were appointed for
that State only. As a general rule these men were
practicing consulting mining engineers in an
area covering one or more mining districts and
seldom went out of their area to execute surveys.
As a result, over a period of time, they developed
a valuable set of survey records pertaining to
claim corners, section corners and mine
workings. Claimants found it advantageous to
employ a mineral surveyor in his district
because of his proximity to the work and his
previously acquired knowledge.</p>

<p class='c003'>With the decline in mining activity due to
mineral deposits being exhausted or reaching
uneconomical depths, and with the improvement
in modes of transportation, mineral
surveyors found themselves covering larger
areas, and many sought appointments in more
than one State. With the formation of the
Bureau of Land Management and the establishment
of areas or regions, the mineral surveyors’
appointments were extended to the area or
region embracing their State and all adjoining
states to the area or region, and finally to all
states subject to the Federal mining laws.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–3</b> Today, mineral surveyors are appointed
by the Chief, Division of Cadastral Survey of the
Bureau of Land Management at Washington,
who acts for the Director. Application may be
made to any State Office or directly to the
Washington Office. The application should
contain a brief resume of the applicant’s
experience in land surveying, mining and
geology and list the states in which he is
registered as a land surveyor, or as a
professional engineer if that state permits
certain classes of professional engineers to do
land surveying. The applicant is cautioned,
however, that appointments are made only if a
need is demonstrated by one of the State
Directors, and he requests that an examination
be held at his office to supplement the roll of
mineral surveyors. Appointments are presently
for a four-year period.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–4</b> Mineral surveyors were originally bonded
and such bonds were usually for a four-year
period. The renewal of these bonds served to
keep the roster of mineral surveyors active.
Bonds are no longer required, but the mineral
surveyor must request renewal of his appointment
60 days before its expiration. Renewal is
based on his activity as a mineral surveyor, the
quality of his work and the timeliness of filing
returns of his surveys. If the record shows that
he has not been actively engaged in executing
mineral surveys, he may be dropped from the
rolls. If he allows his appointment to lapse, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>will not be reinstated or reappointed unless he
demonstrates his capability to make mineral
surveys, and there is a need for additional
mineral surveyors.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–5</b> A mineral surveyor’s appointment may
be revoked at any time for just cause, among
which are: incompetence, gross misconduct,
conflict of interest, failure to personally execute
a survey, failure to prosecute work diligently,
and failure to file timely returns.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–6</b> Before the revocation as stated in 3–5 can
occur, any outstanding surveys or survey orders
must be disposed of by completion, cancellation
or by issuing a new order to another mineral
surveyor, as mutually agreed on by all parties.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Qualification</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>3–7</b> Although the mineral surveyor, as an
employee or officer of the Federal Government,
is not subject to State laws regulating the
practice of land surveying, he will find it
advisable to be registered, at least in his home
State, if not in other states where he engages in
mineral land surveying. Actually, he is only
exempt from registration when he is working
under a mineral survey order and as such he is
limited to work covered by the order. However,
the States of California and Nevada specifically
permit a United States Mineral Surveyor to
make a location survey and to make such survey
a part of the record. (Public Resources Code of
California, Sec. 2311, and 517.210 R.S. Nevada.)
A mineral surveyor would probably not be
questioned in other states if he is making an
amended location survey or field examination
prior to the application for survey. Often,
additional work will be required by the claimant
and the mineral surveyor will have to refer this
work to others or associate with a registered
surveyor. Furthermore, if an applicant for
appointment is not registered in his home State,
the Chief of the Division of Cadastral Survey
may require a more extensive examination so as
to embrace material normally covered in State
examinations.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–8</b> Although basically a land surveyor, the
mineral surveyor should have a working
knowledge of geology, ore deposits and principles
of mining in order to properly execute his
work. He should also be familiar with the
methods of making underground surveys. He
may acquire such knowledge informally by
reading texts on the subjects and through
membership in local mining associations and
organizations.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–9</b> Applicants for appointment as Mineral
Surveyor must pass a 16–hour examination with
a grade of 70 consisting essentially of four parts:</p>

<p class='c003'>1. A solar observation for azimuth consisting
of six consecutive readings, with an engineer’s
transit or double center theodolite, three each
with the telescope in direct and reversed
positions observing opposite limbs of the sun;
together with the necessary calculations to
determine the true meridian. The applicant will
furnish the instrument used.</p>

<p class='c003'>2. Correctly answer questions on the legal
and technical aspects of mineral surveys. Such
questions may be of the true/false or multiple
choice type.</p>

<p class='c003'>3. Solve a practical problem relating to
mining claims, including conflicts, where a set
of conditions are given.</p>

<p class='c003'>4. Prepare a set of field notes and prepare a
preliminary plat from given field data.</p>

<p class='c003'>References and calculators including minicomputers
may be used in the examination. It is
an open book examination.</p>

<p class='c003'>The examination will be held in the office of
the State Director who made the request, but it is
not limited to residents of that State and anyone
whose application has been accepted may take
the examination at his own expense. Upon
successful completion of the examination, the
applicant will furnish the names of three
references who are familiar with his character,
integrity and capability as a surveyor. The
examination is prepared by the Washington
Office and mailed in a sealed envelope bearing
the applicant’s name to the State office. The
completed examination is returned to the
Washington Office in a sealed envelope for each
applicant for grading.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Duties of the Mineral Surveyor</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>3–10</b> The duties of the mineral surveyor
begin with an order for survey and cease with
the approval of that survey. This precludes
using data acquired by former surveys and by
reason of having made the location or amended
location survey, unless such data is verified by
field work and examination after the survey
order is issued.</p>

<p class='c003'>The surveyor should not act as agent for the
claimant in the signing of location or amended
location certificates, although he may post such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>notices for the claimant. <i>The mineral surveyor
is prohibited from taking any part in the patent
application;</i> however, he may assist the attorney
or agent or the claimant himself in
interpreting his field notes, including the area
statement. A mineral surveyor exceeds his
duties if he prepares the notices of application
for patent (24 L.D. 193).</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–11</b> The survey must be made in person by
the mineral surveyor. This does not mean that
every physical act of survey must be performed
by him, but it must be performed under his direct
supervision in the field. The mineral surveyor is
prohibited from delegating such supervision to
employees. In other words, the mineral surveyor
cannot send a field party out to do the work
under his authority without being on the ground
himself. There is no objection to having more
than one survey crew perform the field work as
long as the mineral surveyor can give each crew
adequate supervision. The same rule applies to
office work in connection with the survey.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is nothing that prohibits a mineral
surveyor from being a part of an engineering
and/or surveying firm, but he should be a
principal of that firm. If he works as an
employee of such a firm, he is compromising his
appointment, for as a mineral surveyor he is an
employee of the Bureau of Land Management.</p>

<p class='c003'>He cannot be an employee of the claimant, nor
can he employ the claimant, his attorney or
parties in interest as assistants in making
surveys of mineral claims (43 C.F.R. 3861.3–2).</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–12</b> The survey must be an actual survey on
the ground. This precludes the calculation of ties
and other lines through prior surveys. (See 6
L.D. 718 which disallowed a section corner tie
calculated from another survey and required an
amended survey to run the section tie on the
ground.)</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–13</b> The mineral surveyor should bear in
mind that his field work is subject to spot checks
by cadastral surveyors of the Bureau of Land
Management for sufficiency and accuracy; also,
if his returns of a survey indicate irregularities,
a complete examination by the Bureau of Land
Management may be made. Such field checks
will normally be made when a field party is in
the area during the normal course of a field
season. Irregularities that cannot be resolved
with the mineral surveyor may call for a special
field examination.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Contract for Surveys</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>3–14</b> 43 C.F.R. 3861.4–1 Payment: (a) The
claimant is required in all cases to make
satisfactory arrangements with the surveyor for
the payment for his services and those of his
assistants in making the survey, as the United
States will not be held responsible for the same.
(b) The State Director has no jurisdiction to
settle differences relative to the payment of
charges for field work between mineral surveyors
and claimants. These are matters of
private contract and must be enforced in the
ordinary manner, i.e., in the local courts. The
Department has, however, authority to investigate
charges affecting the official actions
of mineral surveyors, and will, on sufficient
cause shown, suspend or revoke their appointment.
(See 3–1 above.)</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–15</b> 30 U.S.C. 39 states in part: “The
Director of the Bureau of Land Management
shall also have the power to establish the
maximum charges for surveys&nbsp;...; and to the
end that the Director may be fully informed on
the subject, each applicant (for patent) shall file
with the Manager (of the land office) a sworn
statement of all charges and fees paid by such
applicant for&nbsp;... surveys....”</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–16</b> Many factors enter into the ultimate
cost of a mineral survey, such as the terrain,
distance from centers of population, condition of
the public land survey, number of conflicts with
prior surveys and patents, the age of conflicting
surveys, variable weather conditions, and inflation.</p>

<p class='c003'>Cost should be a secondary consideration in
selecting a mineral surveyor and the remuneration
should be such as to assure an adequate job.
Many of the early day surveys of the public
lands resulted in poor or even fraudulent work
because of the low contract price.</p>

<p class='c003'>If a mineral surveyor has had considerable
experience in an area, he may agree to a fixed
price per claim, plus a fixed price per conflict
and per mile of retracement of section lines with
subdivision of sections as required. An alternative
to this is a daily or hourly fee for each
principal or party chief and assistants, plus
expenses at cost, which assures the Bureau of
Land Management and the claimant that
quality will not be sacrificed because of cost. In
the latter case, the mineral surveyor should
provide the claimant with an estimate so that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>will be prepared to meet his invoices. Either type
of contract should provide for periodic
payments, and the mineral surveyor is justified
in requesting an advance deposit. In any event,
payment for the mineral survey is a matter of
private contract; the foregoing are merely
suggestions.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–17</b> Inasmuch as mineral surveyors may
not hold an interest in the public domain (see
Sec. 3–18 below), they are prohibited from
accepting an interest in the claims as payment
for his services.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Restrictions</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>3–18</b> The following is quoted from the
current (1977) letter appointing mineral surveyors:</p>

<p class='c014'>“As a special Government
employee (see <i>Waskey v. Hammer</i>,
223 U.S. 85, 1911), you are subject to
the pertinent conflict of interest
statutes and standards of ethical
conduct as set out in 18 U.S.C. 202
and E.O. 11222, Part III. You and
your wife are prohibited from acquiring
an interest in the public
lands, either directly or indirectly, by
provisions of 43 U.S.C. 11 and 43
C.F.R., Part 7. This prohibition
extends to locating and holding in
your names any mining claims, oil
and gas leases, grazing licenses or
permits, cadastral survey contracts,
or making any other application or
filing under the public land laws.”
43 C.F.R. 7.2 defines interest as
follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>“The term ‘interest’ means any
direct or indirect ownership in whole
or in part of the lands or resources in
question, or any participation in the
earnings therefrom, or the right to
occupy or use the property or to take
any benefits therefrom based on a
lease or rental agreement, or upon
any formal or informal contract with
a person who has such an interest. It
includes membership in a firm, or
ownership of stock or other securities
in a corporation which has such an
interest: Provided, that stock or
securities traded on the open market
may be purchased by an employee if
the acquisition thereof will not tend
to interfere with the proper and
impartial performance of the duties
of the employee or bring discredit
upon the Department.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Employees stationed in Alaska are exempt from
the above, <i>except for a mineral lease or mining
claim</i>, and may acquire one tract of land, not
exceeding five acres, for residence or recreation
purposes. [43 C.F.R. 7.4 (a) (1) and (2).] Retention
of an interest may be approved upon written
request to the Secretary of the Interior, provided
the interest was acquired prior to becoming an
employee or the interest was acquired by gift,
devise, bequest, or by operation of law.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–19</b> The mineral surveyor may be required
to file with the Bureau of Land Management a
“Public Disclosure Statement of Known Financial
Interests” under the Federal Land Policy
and Management Act.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>3–20</b> It should be clear why the foregoing
restrictions are placed on mineral surveyors.
They remove any possible conflict of interest
and the claimant may deal freely with the
mineral surveyor knowing that he cannot
benefit from any information or knowledge
gained during the course of the survey.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h2 class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER IV</span><br /> Application and Order for Survey</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><b>4–1</b> Purpose: Except in special instances,
such as lands selected by the Native Corporations
under the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act, a mining claim may be held
indefinitely as a location by performing the
annual assessment work and making the
necessary affidavits and recordings. However,
once a valuable mineral deposit has been proven
to exist, it may be desirable to obtain absolute
fee title (patent) to the claim which, except in
special cases, includes not only the mineral
estate, but the surface as well. Patent not only
assures possession of the property, but will
facilitate financing as well.</p>

<p class='c003'>Unless the claim is described by legal subdivisions
as in the case of placers and mill sites,
an official survey by a United States Mineral
Surveyor under the direction and with the
approval of the Bureau of Land Management is
the first step in obtaining a patent.</p>

<p class='c003'>Almost universally, the location survey has
not been made with sufficient accuracy or detail
to provide the necessary description for patent.
The patent survey will, in addition to permanently
monumenting and witnessing the
location on the ground, show all conflicts with
prior mineral surveys, fee lands with mineral
rights, and prior locations that the claimant
wishes to exclude. It will also show all the
workings on the claims, both by the claimant
and by others, if any. The survey itself confers
no rights; patent must follow.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>4–2</b> Selecting a Mineral Surveyor: A list of
approved and active mineral surveyors may be
obtained from any State Office, or from the
Director, Bureau of Land Management, at
Washington, D.C. Mineral surveyors’ appointments
cover all states where the mining
laws are applicable.</p>

<p class='c003'>Usually, it will be advantageous to select a
mineral surveyor close to the project, or one who
has worked in the area and has a knowledge of
existing surveys. All mineral surveyors are not
equally experienced. Their appointment means
that they have met certain qualifications and
have satisfactorily demonstrated a knowledge
of mineral survey procedures.</p>

<p class='c003'>More than one mineral surveyor should be
consulted before making a selection. His proposed
method of making the survey, his availability
and time schedule, as well as fees should be
discussed. Fees should be a secondary consideration
and may be on a time and expense
basis or a flat contract price. If a flat price is to
be decided, the mineral surveyor will probably
want to first make an examination of the
property. In any event, the arrangement
between the mineral surveyor and the claimant
is a matter of private contract, and the Bureau of
Land Management will not be responsible.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even after a survey has been started, the
claimant may discharge a mineral surveyor and
select another, but such action will call for an
amended order for survey.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>4–3</b> Selecting an Attorney: An attorney-at-law
to act as agent for the claimant in the patent
proceedings is not necessary; the claimant can
make the application for patent himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>However, an attorney well-versed in mining
law can be a big asset and arrangements should
be made prior to the survey so that he will be
available for consultation. The mineral surveyor
will know of attorneys with whom he has
previously worked and may be able to make
recommendations. The attorney’s fee may be
negotiated. If the claimant is a large corporation,
it may have staff attorneys or landmen
that can handle the patent application.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mineral surveyor may not assist in the
patent proceedings. His help may be required in
determining the net area of the claim from the
area statement in the mineral surveyor’s field
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>notes. There is no objection to the mineral
surveyor interpreting his notes, and assisting in
this regard.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>4–4</b> Application for Survey: Must be made
by claimant(s) or his agent on current Form
3860–5 (see appendix). Instructions are on the
back of the form.</p>

<p class='c003'>1. The name of the applicant (claimant)
should be given exactly as it is to appear in the
patent, together with his post office address.</p>

<p class='c003'>2. Group name (if any). If the claims are
known by a group name, it may be placed here.
If they do not have a group name, it may be
omitted.</p>

<p class='c003'>3. Name(s) of claim(s) should appear exactly
as they are given in the location certificate, e.g.,
Molly No. 1 should not be given as Molly #1. The
date the claim was first located and recorded in
the present chain of title must be given; the
dates of amendment are only the last amendment
made.</p>

<p class='c003'>4. The location of the claims by section,
township and range (stating that it is unsurveyed
if based on protracted survey lines),
county and state must be given. If not within a
national forest, “None” should be used in the
blank provided.</p>

<p class='c003'>5a. To support the application, furnish two
copies of the location notice (or last amended
location with the original location and recordation
date shown thereon). One copy must be
certified by the custodian of the records where
mining claims are locally recorded (usually the
County Clerk and Recorder).</p>

<p class='c003'>5b. The claim must be monumented on the
ground so that the mineral surveyor can
identify it.</p>

<p class='c003'>6. In accordance with the instructions, a
deposit in the proper amount must be made to
cover the costs of the Bureau of Land Management
in processing the survey.</p>

<p class='c003'>7. The mineral surveyor designated must be
one with whom prior arrangements have been
made for the survey. The Bureau of Land
Management may request proof, in the form of a
simple letter from the mineral surveyor, that he
has agreed to make the survey. The application
should then be dated and signed by the
applicant(s), if a corporation by the authorized
officer, or by the Attorney-in-fact if by an agent
acting for the applicant. Proof of authorized
signature will not be required by the Bureau of
Land Management at this time, but will be
required at the time application for patent is
made.</p>

<p class='c003'>Several claims, generally limited to 50 in
number, may be embraced in a single survey
provided they are contiguous, i.e., not merely
cornering; they must adjoin with common
boundaries or overlap. Limiting the number of
claims to be embraced in a single survey is
arbitrary, but set at approximately 50 in order to
facilitate processing. Two groups of claims may
be embraced in a single survey if they both
adjoin a group previously surveyed for patent
and are owned in common.</p>

<p class='c003'>Occasions have arisen where the group of
claims lies in two states. Applications for survey
should be made in each state for the claims or
portions thereof which lie in that state. A survey
number will be assigned in each state for the
portion lying within each state, but the survey
will be assigned for processing to the State
where the majority of the claims lie. (See Surs.
Nos. 10631 Montana, 3168 Idaho.)</p>

<p class='c003'><b>4–5</b> Records Search: Prior to applying for
the mineral survey, the claimant or his agent
should make a search of the county records to
determine if the claims are in conflict with other
mining claim locations. If so, copies of the
location certificates should be obtained for the
mineral surveyor. If the claims are prior valid
locations and the claimant wishes to exclude
them from his patent application, the mineral
surveyor will be required to show the conflict as
it exists on the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>If it is not the desire to exclude such claims, no
mention of them will be made in the field notes
of the mineral survey, but the mineral surveyor
will be aware of them when he goes on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>The claimant should also make a search of the
Bureau of Land Management records, particularly
the Master Title Plats (M.T. Plats) to
determine conflict with prior patents and
withdrawals. Connecting sheets, if available,
which show in outline all approved mineral
surveys, should also be examined for conflicts
with prior mineral surveys. The BLM record of
unsurveyed locations should also be searched.</p>

<p class='c003'>The claimant should make certain that his
discovery point is on vacant public domain,
which includes minerals reserved to the United
States where the patent is for the surface only.</p>

<p class='c003'>If two or more claims are involved, each must
have its own discovery and both discoveries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>may not be in an area of conflict between two
claims.</p>

<p class='c003'>The length and width of each lode claim must
be checked to make certain that statutory length
of 1500 feet has not been exceeded and that the
right angle distance of no more than 300 feet
exists on each side of the presumed course of the
vein (lode line).</p>

<p class='c003'>The acreage of all claims and the length of
placers must be checked for excess. If excesses
appear to exist the mineral surveyor should be
advised of them and directed to survey the claim
within the boundaries given so as to eliminate
such excess.</p>

<p class='c003'>While metes and bounds descriptions of lode
claims are not mandatory, the description must
be such that the locus of the claim can be
determined. While a tie to a section is preferable,
a tie to another mineral survey, mineral location
monument, or triangulation station of the
National Geodetic Survey or U.S. Geological
Survey is acceptable provided they can be
identified with the public land survey. Ties to
bench marks are not acceptable.</p>

<p class='c003'>Irregular claims, such as placer claims or mill
sites, must have a metes and bounds description
closing within 0.50 feet in 1,000 feet. The acreage
of lode claims cannot exceed 20.661 acres.
Placers may not exceed 20 acres to each
claimant, exclusive of conflict, and mill sites
may not exceed 5 acres, exclusive of conflict.</p>

<p class='c003'>One of the location certificate copies must be
certified by the custodian of the local records,
usually the County Clerk and Recorder.</p>

<p class='c003'>If any of the above items are not in order, it
will be necessary to require the claimant to file
an amended location certificate that will properly
describe the claim. If the error in the
certificate is small, or there is an obvious clerical
error, such as calling for a bearing of
N.——W. when it should be N.——E. it
will suffice to state in the final field notes that
the location certificate is in error.</p>

<p class='c003'>To aid in determining the locus and relative
position of several claims, the claimant may be
called upon to furnish a diagram. If the
certificate is marginal in detail, it is proper to
suggest to the mineral surveyor that an amended
location certificate be filed and an amended
order for survey obtained before completing his
survey. It is also proper to set a time limit for the
completion of the survey and filing returns.</p>

<p class='c003'>After receipt of the survey order, the Mineral
Surveyor should obtain copies of necessary
survey records, including MT Plat, the notes of
township surveys, conflicting mineral surveys,
including the reports as to the condition of
corners and survey discrepancies contained
under other corner descriptions and supplemental
data, Homestead Entry Surveys and Exchange
Surveys on Forest Service lands, Small
Claims, Homesites, Trade and Manufacturing
Sites, Rights-of-Way and Townsites. He should
also consult the State and County records for
restored section corners and subdivision of
sections. A visit with the County Surveyor will
often prove profitable.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>4–6</b> Order for Survey: The order for
survey is issued by the State Director of the
Bureau of Land Management or he may
delegate this action to the Chief, Branch of
Cadastral Surveys.</p>

<p class='c003'>The order for survey is issued on current Form
3860–6, (see appendix) or may be in letter form.
The information given is essentially the same as
contained in the application for survey. The
names of the locations must be exactly as given
in the location certificates.</p>

<p class='c003'>The next consecutive survey number is
assigned; a number from a cancelled survey or
survey order should not be used. Lodes and
placers may be included in the same survey. If a
mill site is included, it is designated by adding
the letter “B” to the survey number; the other
claims being designated “A.”</p>

<p class='c003'>A copy of the location certificates should be
furnished to the mineral surveyor, and a copy of
the order to the claimant; also to the Regional
Forester if the claims are within a National
Forest, or the National Park Service if within a
National Park or Monument.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>4–7</b> Amended (or Supplemental) Order for
Survey: An amended order is based on an
amended application from the claimant. It is
usually occasioned by the filing of amended
location certificates. The amended application
is processed exactly the same as the original
application.</p>

<p class='c003'>An amended order is also called for if there is
an addition or deletion of claims from the
survey.</p>

<p class='c003'>A change in mineral surveyor will call for an
amended order, but the order to the original
mineral surveyor must be cancelled.</p>

the survey of additional expenditures if the
survey was approved without $500 of expenditures
being made. (See Sec. 5–21)</p>

<p class='c003'><b>4–8</b> Cancellation of the Survey Order: The
most common reason for cancelling a survey
order is failure of the mineral surveyor to
complete the survey and file his returns. Under
these circumstances, both the claimant and the
mineral surveyor should be advised 30 days in
advance of the action and be requested to show
why the order should not be cancelled. If any
reasonable explanation is given, the time
should be extended. Lacking reasonable explanation
the order will be cancelled, notifying
both the claimant and the mineral surveyor,
and any excess deposit is returned to the
claimant.</p>

<p class='c003'>Other reasons for cancelling a survey are a
request to do so by the claimant, or if the claim
has been declared null and void due to a contest
brought by the United States.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mineral survey number of a cancelled
survey will not be used again, unless reopened
as an amended survey and would then be shown
with an “Am.” following the mineral survey
number.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER V</span><br /> The Patent Survey</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>Field Work</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>5–1</b> Preliminary: The first step in the field
work should be an examination of the property
with the claimant or his representative, unless
such an examination was made prior to contracting
for the survey. A sufficient number of claim
corners should be visited to determine the
material used, their condition, manner of
marking, etc. In the course of such an examination,
the claimant should point out known
section corners, location monuments and
triangulation stations, both of the U.S.
Geological Survey and the National Geodetic
Survey. The claimant may also be able to
identify corners of adjoining and conflicting
surveys and locations. If the property is extensive,
the claimant may have established his own
triangulation network and coordinate system,
and if so, it should be incorporated into the
survey, although not necessarily made a part of
the official record.</p>

<p class='c003'>All the discovery workings should be visited,
the discovery points and discovery monuments
pointed out. Other workings should be visited
and the safety of old underground workings
discussed. Maps of underground workings may
be available. Workings constructed by third
parties should also be identified.</p>

<p class='c003'>Relations with landowners and other
claimants in the area may be established with
the help of the claimant. In addition to gaining
access to the property and to their property for
the purpose of executing the survey, they may
have helpful information as to the location of
section corners and the origin of fences.</p>

<p class='c003'>If access is refused, it may be necessary to
obtain help from the U.S. Marshall, but if
properly handled in advance of the field work,
the necessary permission will usually be
granted. The fact may be stressed that you are a
government official and that your work will be
impartial. Emphasize that as a qualified surveyor,
you are bound to protect all valid
interests, property rights, and evidence.</p>

<p class='c003'>Copies of the claimant’s maps of the property
showing the claim boundaries, discovery and
other workings and access roads should be
obtained from the claimant. The claimant may
also have aerial photos which will be helpful in
planning the survey.</p>

<p class='c003'>Descriptions of all triangulation stations
should be obtained. The plat and field note
record of all prior mineral surveys in conflict or
adjoining, as well as a copy of the connected
sheet should be ordered, if not previously
furnished with the survey order. The county
records pertaining to surveys and particularly
the restoration of section corners should be
searched. The county surveyor may be helpful.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the field examination reveals that there are
insufficient location corners on the ground to
identify the claims, an amended location survey
with the resulting amended location certificates
and request for an amended order for survey will
be necessary.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–2</b> Survey Methods: The preliminary field
examination will suggest the best method of
survey. This will be dictated largely by the
nature of the terrain and the amount of timber
and brush. Modern methods employing
theodolites and electronic distance measuring
equipment should be used. Regardless of the
method used, the work must be sufficiently
checked to assure that errors will be avoided.
Most errors occur when adjusting corners to
their final position.</p>

<p>EXECUTING A MINERAL PATENT SURVEY<br /><br />(Transit and Tape Method)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span><b>5–3</b> Executing the Survey: The survey is
usually initiated by retracing the boundaries of
the location, or tying-in the corners, along with
the discovery monuments and discovery points.
Readily identified corners of conflicting surveys
and section corners should also be tied in. The
relative positions of the corners and discovery
points are then determined by calculated
bearings and distances. If the boundaries are
within the statutory length and width (1500 x
600 ft.), the end lines are parallel and the
sidelines are within 300 feet on either side of the
discovery point, the survey may proceed.</p>

<p class='c003'>If only small corner moves of a foot or so will
make the claim conform, an amendment is
hardly necessary; otherwise, the corners should
be moved and amended location certificates
filed.</p>

<p class='c003'>A single claim may be surveyed within the
location boundaries, without amendment, as
long as the above conditions are met.</p>

<p class='c003'>New discoveries may be necessary, but if
intervening rights are suspected, it is better to
hold to the original discovery points and stake
fractional claims as required.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the deposit is a blanket vein or massive
deposit, the discovery may be anywhere within
the claim, except in Wyoming where State law
requires that the side lines be equidistant from
the discovery.</p>

<p class='c003'>If no public land survey corners or location
monuments (or other horizontal control
stations) can be found within two miles of the
survey it will be necessary to establish a
location monument. The requirements are given
in Sections 10–32, 33 and 34 of the Manual of
Surveying Instructions. There was a period
when these monuments were called “Mineral
Monuments” and were designated “U.S.M.M.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Conflicts with prior mineral surveys must be
determined. It is necessary to search for each
corner controlling a line in conflict. One corner
is insufficient if others can be found. If the
necessary corners cannot be found the
boundaries shall be reestablished (not
remonumented since the property belongs to
another party) in accordance with the methods
set forth in Chapter VI.</p>

<p class='c003'>Conflicts with unsurveyed locations are not to
be shown unless it is the wish of the claimant to
exclude them from his patent. If they are prior
locations, it may be well to do this in order to
avoid an adverse suit. Conflicts with unsurveyed
locations owned by the claimant and
not a part of the survey need not be shown and
excluded unless the area of conflict contains the
discovery of the unsurveyed location. In cases
where two claims of the survey are in conflict,
the discovery of each claim may not be within
the area of conflict. If so, an amended location is
necessary to show a new discovery for one of the
claims, outside the area of conflict.</p>

<p class='c003'>If fee lands with mineral rights are in conflict,
a subdivision of the section(s) may be necessary.
This will depend on the wishes of the
claimant and the Bureau of Land Management.
An extensive resurvey that would place a
hardship on the claimant should not be required.
If a subdivision can readily be accomplished,
it should be done.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is not necessary to fix the boundaries of
stock-raising homesteads since the minerals are
reserved to the United States and belong to the
mining claim in areas of conflict.</p>

<p class='c003'>Special surveys such as townsites, Homestead
Entry Surveys, U.S. Surveys and Coal Surveys
in Alaska are treated as are prior mineral
surveys. Rights-of-way should not be shown as
the minerals are reserved, and when the right-of-way
is abandoned, the surface reverts to the
mining claim. In Alaska, native graves must be
tied-in. Cemeteries should be shown.</p>

<p class='c003'>Figure 5 shows Sur. Nos. 1234 A lode and 1235
B lode in conflict with the XYZ lode that is being
surveyed for patent. Cors. Nos. 1 and 4 of Sur.
No. 1234 A lode control the line of conflict with
that claim. If they can be found, no further
search is necessary; if they cannot, the search
must be continued for Cors. Nos. 2 and 3. In the
case of Sur. No. 1235, all four corners are
required to be found in order to properly show
the conflict.</p>

<p class='c003'>Figure 6 shows the ABC and XYZ lodes, both
of which are being surveyed for patent under the
same survey order. The discovery shafts of both
claims are in the area of conflict. In order to
validate the claims, a new discovery must be
shown for one of them, outside the conflict. It
need not be the later claim as the owner has the
right to decide which claim shall exclude the
conflict.</p>

<p class='c003'>If amended location certificates are filed for
record, it will be necessary to make an amended
application for survey to the Bureau of Land
Management based on the amended certificates,
and receive an amended order for
survey. It will not be necessary to suspend field
work pending such amendment, but it is
advisable to refrain from marking the corners
and accessories with the survey number until
the amended order is received.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><b>5–4</b> Monumenting the Survey: Section
10–35 of the Manual of Surveying Instructions,
1973 lists corner monuments in their order of
preference.</p>

<p class='c003'>Accessories to the corner generally consist of
bearing trees or bearing rocks. If trees are
available, two different species at approximately
right angles from each other to the
corner should, if possible, be selected and
marked differently so that each can be readily
identified. For example: one might be a Douglas
Fir, 10 inches diameter, bears N. 10° E., 20.65
feet dist., blazed and scribed 1 W—2826 X BT;
the other a Ponderosa Pine, 7 inches diameter,
bears S. 70° E., 12.52 feet dist., blazed and
marked X BT. In each case the measurement
should be taken to the X which is in contrast to
the bearing trees to section corners, the
measurement being taken to the center of the
trees. If the measurement is to the center of the
tree, an X should not be included in the
markings.</p>

<p class='c003'>The difference between a pine, spruce and fir
can be identified by the needles, the pine having
needles in bundles, the spruce having needles
square in cross section, and the fir having flat
needles.</p>

<p class='c003'>Bearing rocks should be marked X B O or X B
R with the measurement taken to the X; the rock
or outcrop being of sufficient size to be readily
identifiable.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ties along claim boundaries to items of
planimetry and drainage surrounding the
corner may be taken at this time. Ties to section
corners, location monuments and triangulation
stations may also be made at this time if they
are close to a corner.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is no objection to monumenting corners
that fall on patented land. If they fall in a
cultivated field they should be buried at least
one foot in the ground. If the landowner objects,
a witness corner may be set. Witness corners
should also be set if the corner falls at an
inaccessible point (see Section 4–17 of the
Manual of Surveying Instructions). If the corner
falls in a road, it is advisable to bury the corner
at the true point and set reference monuments at
equal distances on either side of the road (see
Section 4–16 of the Manual of Surveying Instructions).</p>

<p class='c003'>Location posts, such as a 4×4 post in good
condition, may be set alongside the patent
survey corners as a guard post and to aid in
calling attention to it.</p>

<p class='c003'>In selecting corner numbers, there is no rule
other than Cor. No. 1 should be the corner from
which the tie is given to the section corner or
location monument. When surveying a block of
claims common corners should be given the
same number thereby reducing the number of
section corner ties required from Cor. No. 1. This
facilitates field note writing as well as platting.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–5</b> Improvements: All improvements made
by the claimant or his grantors are to be tied
to a corner of the survey, measured, and a
value placed thereon if they are such as to count
toward the $500 patent expenditure. If they are
to count as patent expenditure, they must be in
the nature of actual mining improvements, such
as cuts, tunnels, shafts, drill holes, etc.; in other
words, an improvement that tends to develop or
explore the mineral deposit.</p>

<p class='c003'>Improvements such as cabins, ore bins, roads,
bridges, etc., do not develop the claim, but
should be tied in, measured and included under
“OTHER IMPROVEMENTS” in the field notes,
without a value.</p>

<p class='c003'>Work done by third parties must also be tied-in
and listed under “OTHER IMPROVEMENTS.”
If the claimant to such work is unknown, that
fact should be stated. Again, no value is to be
placed on these improvements.</p>

<p class='c003'>The value to be placed on small improvements
can readily be ascertained by multiplying the
local wage or cost of equipment and operator by
the length of time required to do the work. Drill
holes may be valued at the cost of drilling, plus
the cost of surveying, geologic evaluation and
assaying. Larger improvements may not be as
easy to estimate, and it may be necessary to go
to the claimant’s cost records in order to place a
reasonable value on them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Common improvements require special consideration.
See Sections 10–55, 10–56, and 10–57
of the Manual of Surveying Instructions. A
common improvement is one that tends to
benefit several claims of a common group. It
must have been constructed in its entirety
subsequent to the location of each claim of the
group, or at least $500 must have been spent on
the improvement subsequent to the location of
each claim of the common group. All claims
within range of benefit must be included, even
though they were previously surveyed, or if they
are locations which are not included in the
survey. The field notes must recite all the claims
involved, whether previously surveyed or unsurveyed.</p>

<p>AN ADIT (TUNNEL) LEADING TO EXTENSIVE UNDERGROUND WORKINGS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Improvements need not be surveyed with the
same accuracy as the claim boundaries. Stadia
measurements are acceptable, although they
should be made with a Philadelphia Rod and
distances kept under 500 feet. Small workings
may be measured with a Brunton Compass and
steel tape, but some point of the working, such as
the mouth of a tunnel or cut, must be tied to a
corner of the survey using a transit.</p>

<p class='c003'>Surveys of extensive underground workings
may be taken from the claimant’s records if such
surveys were executed under the supervision of
a mining engineer.</p>

<p class='c003'>Extreme care should be exercised in entering
old workings. In addition to unsafe timbering,
they may be poorly ventilated resulting in bad
air that could be fatal. Rather than risk an
accident, the extent of such workings can be
estimated from the size of the dump.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ties to discovery workings require special
mention in view of the directive from the
Assistant Director of Technical Services,
Washington, D.C., dated March 15, 1978.</p>

<p class='c003'>Normally the discovery working is on the lode
or intersects it and a tie is given along the lode
line to the point of discovery, such as the face of
the discovery cut, the mouth of the discovery
tunnel, the center of the discovery shaft, etc.</p>

<p class='c003'>However, in the case of blanket veins that are
essentially horizontal a presumed lode line or
center line need not be shown, and the discovery
working may be anywhere on the claim. In such
cases, the tie may be given from the nearest
corner of the survey and included in the
description of that corner, or a right angle tie
may be given from a point on the nearest end
line.</p>

<p class='c003'>Where a discovery has been made by a hole
drilled on an angle, a bearing and distance will
be given from the collar of the drill hole to the
point where it intersects the orebody, the collar
of the hole will in turn be tied to the section
corner or location monument. The description of
the hole will necessarily include the verticle
angle and the slope distance. This does not
apply to Wyoming where State law requires that
the discovery be on the center line.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–6</b> Placer Claims: Placer claims that do
not conform to the legal subdivisions of the
public land survey will require a patent survey.
When such claims are on unsurveyed land they
should be conformed as nearly as possible to the
protracted survey.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the claims consist of a gulch placer they
must be contained within the required number
of 40 acre tracts according to the number of
locators.</p>

<p class='c003'>Metes and bounds placers are also permissible
where conflicts with other mining claims would
result if a description by legal subdivisions was
used. In such cases, the placer claim must be
surveyed around existing claims, so that no
conflict exists.</p>

<p class='c003'>The field notes of a placer claim must also
contain a descriptive report as called for in the
Code of Federal Regulations, 3863.1–3(c). The
information required in the descriptive report
was omitted from the 1973 Manual of Surveying
Instructions but was contained in the 1947
manual as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>“The mineral surveyor is required
to make a full examination of all
placer claims at the time of survey
 ... and to file with his field notes a
descriptive report&nbsp;... duly corroborated
by one or more disinterested
persons and covering the
following items:</p>

<p class='c014'>(a) The quality and composition of
the soil, the kind and amount of
timber and other vegetation;</p>

<p class='c014'>(b) The location and size of
streams, and such other matter as
may appear upon the surface of the
claims;</p>

<p class='c014'>(c) The character, extent, and
position of all surface and underground
workings for mining purposes;</p>

<p class='c014'>(d) The proximity of centers of
trade or residence;</p>

<p class='c014'>(e) The proximity of well-known
systems of lode deposits or of individual
lodes;</p>

<p class='c014'>(f) The use or adaptability of the
claim for placer mining, including
the availability of water in sufficient
quantity for practical operations;</p>

<p class='c014'>(g) Works or expenditures made
by the claimant or his grantors for
the development of the claim; and,</p>

<p class='c014'>(h) The true position of all known
mines, salt licks and salt springs,
and mill sites. When none is known
to exist on the claim, the fact will be
so stated.”</p>

<p>A URANIUM TAILINGS OR EVAPORATION POND</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><b>5–7</b> Mill Sites: Modern day mining and
milling require sizable areas for waste storage,
tailings and evaporation ponds. Camp sites,
including schools, may be required for personnel
employed at the mine or mill. Such areas
are properly taken as mill sites and a large
number may be required. They may be taken by
legal subdivisions but often are surveyed, either
with lode or placer claims or separately. If they
are included in a survey with lodes or placers the
survey number includes the letter “B”, while the
other claims are designated “A”.</p>

<p class='c003'>A mill site is not a valid location until it is put
in use; therefore, all improvements and projected
improvements should be shown. If the
ground is to be used for a tailings or evaporation
pond, the dam should be shown with its ultimate
height and the high water line of the pond
delineated by the survey.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is also important to demonstrate the non-mineral
character of the land. In the case of
adjoining blanket deposits such as uranium, a
few scattered drill holes will show the absence of
a mineral deposit.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Office Work</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>5–8</b> Calculation: The first step will be to
reduce coordinate positions to direct ties, starting
with the section corner ties, followed by
short ties between claims of the survey should
these claims actually overlap. In selecting the
corners to tie, the tie between corners should be
given that will facilitate the calculation of
intersections and areas by solving triangles.</p>

<p class='c003'>As illustrated by Figure 6, claims ABC and
XYZ are in the same survey. A tie should be
given from Cor. No. 1 of claim ABC to Cor. No. 2
of claim XYZ; not between Corners 1 and 3. After
these ties have been calculated, they should be
checked by calculating closures using the
various short ties and section corner ties.</p>

<p class='c003'>In selecting corners of conflicting surveys to
give tie to, the corner within the survey as
illustrated in Figure 5 should be selected. The tie
to Sur. No. 1235 B lode should be to Cor. No. 1
from Cor. No. 1 of the XYZ lode, or to Cor. No. 2
from Cor. No. 4.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lines of prior mineral surveys between
recovered corners should be reported as correct
or substantially correct as approved. If found in
error the correct bearing and distance should be
given.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Figure 5, if Cors. Nos. 1, 2 and 4 of Sur. No.
1235 B lode were recovered, lines 1–2 and 4–1
should be reported. Lines 2–3 and 3–4 cannot be
reported since Cor. No. 3 was not found. If the tie
from Cor. No. 1 is to the same section corner as
used in the survey of claim XYZ, then the
correctness of the tie should be reported. If Cor.
No. 1 was not recovered, the section corner tie
cannot be reported.</p>

<p class='c003'>The position of missing corners should be
fixed in accordance with Chapter VI. The
remaining lines can then be reported as fixed by
the selected method of restoration.</p>

<p class='c003'>Intersections and areas of conflict should
then be calculated by solving triangles. Areas
may be calculated using double meridian
distances, but intersections should never be
calculated by forcing a closure. Intersections
may be checked by closure.</p>

<p class='c003'>A special situation exists where a former
survey excluded an unsurveyed location from
the patent and the unsurveyed location has
subsequently been abandoned. This area is
designated as a tract and its boundaries are
determined from the prior survey. See Tract A of
the Jim Dandy Lode described in the specimen
field notes and plat of the Manual of Surveying
Instructions.</p>

<p class='c003'>Another use of a tract is for the purpose of
excluding a small area surrounding the discovery
of another location not embraced in the
survey.</p>

<p class='c003'>Intersections and areas of conflict with
patented lands containing mineral rights must
also be calculated.</p>

<p class='c003'>Supporting calculation sheets need not be
furnished the Bureau of Land Management but
computer tapes, if available, will be helpful. The
BLM can perform the necessary checks by
computer.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–9</b> Preliminary Plat: The mineral surveyor
will find it advantageous to prepare preliminary
plats prior to writing the field notes. One plat
should provide the base and give all the details
of the survey with items of topography and
culture secondary. This plat may be prepared in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>pencil or ink at the option of the mineral
surveyor. It should be such that legible blue
lines copies can be furnished to the Bureau of
Land Management along with the notes, and to
the claimant. It should clearly state that it is a
PRELIMINARY PLAT SUBJECT TO CORRECTION.
Some offices of the Bureau of Land
Management may request a reproducible copy.</p>

<p class='c003'>Plats on linen are no longer required. A
secondary plat showing the topography and
culture in detail will be an aid in writing field
notes, but is not required by the BLM.</p>

<p class='c003'>If drill holes are part of the improvements and
are too numerous to show on the base plat, a
separate plat is advisable.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–10</b> Field Notes: A detailed set of
specimen field notes is contained in the Manual
of Surveying Instructions which should be
followed for form and content. There are,
however, some inconsistencies: The title page
shown in the manual should not be used. Use
current Form 3400–11, as supplied by the
Bureau of Land Management.</p>

<p class='c003'>The locations should be listed in the same
order that they are described in the field notes,
thereby serving as an index.</p>

<p class='c003'>The field notes begin with a description of
instruments and the mean results of the solar or
other azimuthal observations. The latitude and
longitude of the observing station is given. If
this is not at a corner of the survey, the latitude
and longitude of the first corner described
should be given, thus:</p>

<p class='c014'>At Cor. No. 1 of the Jim Dandy lode,
identical with Cor. No. 1 of the Prince
Lode of this survey, in latitude 38°45′
N, and longitude 106°20′ W.</p>

<p class='c003'>A description of the measuring devices
follows the observation for azimuth. If an
electronic distance measuring device is used, the
name and serial number should be given. It
should also be stated that it was tested by
measuring a known distance before and after
the survey, and found correct.</p>

<p class='c003'>Corner markings as shown are acceptable for
stone monuments or wood posts. When a
monument with a cap is used, the following
marks would be more suitable:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/dgm-001.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c003'>The X has been omitted from the inscription
on bearing trees which is incorrect, unless the
measurement was taken to the center of the tree.
It should be included, thus: JD–1–20220A XBT
or JD–1–PRI–1–20220A XBT if the full complement
of marks are shown.</p>

<p class='c003'>When giving intersections only the distance
to the line being intersected is given for claims of
the survey as the distance to the corner on the
line being intersected will be given later in the
notes when that claim is described.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the intersection is with a prior mineral
survey or unsurveyed location, the distance
should be given to a corner within the claim, or
the same corner each time the line is intersected.
See the intersection of lines 2–3 and 3–4 of the
Protector lode with Sur. No. 20100 Silver lode.</p>

<p class='c003'>Note that intersections are given to the
nearest hundredth of a foot, while distances to
items of topography and culture are to the
nearest foot. Distances given in ties including
bearing objects should be to the hundredth of a
foot.</p>

<p class='c003'>The area statement should show all conflicts
and be so arranged that any exclusion may be
made and the net area to be patented readily
obtainable. This can best be done by starting
with the oldest survey and progressing through
the various conflicts, but this may not hold true
if a prior survey has not been patented. A copy of
the preliminary plat may be used to color the
exclusions and make certain that all have been
properly stated.</p>

<p class='c003'>Under the heading “LOCATION” it is important
to state that the survey is identical with the
location as marked on the ground or to state the
differences. When describing corners, ties
should be given to location monuments when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>they are not identical. See the Prince Lode in the
specimen notes.</p>

<p class='c003'>Only those improvements counting toward
the $500 expenditure are to be given under the
heading “IMPROVEMENTS.” In such case, the
discovery working should be numbered one. If
there is no discovery working, but a discovery
point is called for, it may be described and
labeled No. 1. Any improvements that do not
count toward the patent expenditure or those
that have been made by others should be listed
under “OTHER IMPROVEMENTS.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“OTHER CORNER DESCRIPTIONS AND
SUPPLEMENTAL DATA” is a very important
part of the notes since it contains the report on
prior surveys. Do not report another mineral
surveyor in error for minor discrepancies in
bearings and distances. The phrase, “substantially
correct as approved” may be used, or
“approximately correct as approved.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Under “MEMORANDUM” differences with
the calls given in the location certificate may be
explained, as well as typographical errors in the
certificate.</p>

<p class='c003'>Because of corrections that may be required
by the Bureau of Land Management it is well to
prepare a preliminary draft of the notes for
submitting to the BLM. The final typing, in
triplicate, can be accomplished after all
differences have been resolved.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–11</b> The field notes and preliminary plat
should be sent to the State Office of the Bureau
of Land Management by either certified or
registered mail with a return receipt requested.
A copy of the preliminary plat may also be sent
to the claimant with a copy of the letter of
transmittal to the BLM.</p>

<p class='c003'>As a rule, the returns of mineral survey should
remain confidential until the survey is approved.
The mineral surveyor should maintain
this confidence. If a demand is made of the
Bureau of Land Management under the
Freedom of Information Act, then the
preliminary nature of the work should be clearly
stated to the recipient.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Processing the Survey</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>5–12</b> Preliminary Examination of Field
Notes: The examination of the survey may
begin by reading the notes and comparing them
with the preliminary plat. As a general rule the
mineral surveyor will write the notes from the
plat. If inconsistencies appear, they will usually
be typographical errors in the notes. However,
this must be verified by the mineral surveyor.</p>

<p class='c003'>Particular attention should be given to the
format as shown by the specimen notes of the
Manual of Surveying Instructions, 1973.</p>

<p class='c003'>Corner descriptions must be proper and
adequate. Ties should agree with the
preliminary plat. Discovery points must be on
public domain.</p>

<p class='c003'>By posting the mineral survey to the connecting
sheet or similar plat with a pencil, conflicts
and other surveys within 100 feet may be
determined.</p>

<p class='c003'>The names of the locations must agree with
those given in the location certificates. End
lines must be parallel and the statutory length
and width cannot be exceeded. Improvements
should be fairly valued; the discovery point
should agree with that given in the location
certificate; common improvements should be
correctly described and all claims benefiting
therefrom should share equally. The geographic
position of one corner of the survey must be
given. Under “LOCATION” the correct section,
township and range should be given.</p>

<p class='c003'>It should be stated that the survey is identical
with the location as marked on the ground. If
not identical, it should be so stated, and ties to
location monuments must be given.</p>

<p class='c003'>The section corner tie may not exceed two
miles from the nearest corner of the survey.
Intersections with the lode lines and distances
along the lode line to the discovery point must be
given. (Exception: bedded deposits.) The bearing
of the lode line, if different from the side
lines, must be shown on the plat.</p>

<p class='c003'>Reports on former surveys should be checked
against the notes of these surveys. The bearings
and distances of lines of former surveys that are
wholly within the survey or a claim of the survey
must be given.</p>

<p class='c003'>The area statement should be reviewed to
make certain that conflicts are given in
chronological order and that any exclusion or
combination of exclusions can be ascertained.</p>

<p class='c003'>The magnetic declination must be given. The
beginning and completion dates of the survey
must be given. The survey cannot begin prior to
the date of order.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–13</b> Calculations: Calculations may begin
by computing the solar observation; the declination
should be verified, also the latitude and
longitude. The survey should close. Lode claims
should have a perfect closure; irregular claims
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>such as placers should close within 0.5 feet in
1,000  feet. The statutory length and width of
lode claims may not be exceeded. The width at
right angles to the lode cannot exceed 300 feet on
either side. The section corner ties within the
survey may be checked by closure, using short
ties between claims of the survey; each section
tie and short tie should be used in at least one
closure. The closures should not exceed 0.5 feet
in 1,000 feet. (It may be necessary to report the
longer section ties to an even number of seconds
such as 15″.)</p>

<p class='c003'>The section corner ties should be checked
against those given in conflicting surveys using
the short ties given to these claims along with
the reported boundaries. Such closures, depending
on the length of the ties, should not exceed 10
feet. If they do exceed this distance, the correct
tie should be given under “OTHER CORNER
DESCRIPTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL
DATA” provided that the corner from which the
tie was made was recovered. If the corner was
not found, the error cannot be reported. The
same applies to short ties between conflicting
surveys, but the allowable error should be
within the 1:2000 limit. If more than one section
corner is tied, the bearing and distance along
the section line should be checked, reporting any
appreciable difference under “OTHER CORNER
DESCRIPTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL
DATA.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The bearings and distances of intersections
with lines of prior surveys should be correctly
stated. This may be verified by closure, but if a
closure of 1:2000 is not obtained, it will be
necessary to calculate the intersections by
solving triangles, to determine where the error
lies. Such intersections should check with 0.2
feet.</p>

<p class='c003'>From the intersections obtained, the areas of
conflict should next be calculated. If the final
plat is drawn at a scale of 1″ = 200′, conflicts with
a conflict, i.e. double conflicts, may be checked
by dividing the area of conflict into triangles
and scaling the base and altitude. The mineral
surveyor, however, must actually calculate
these areas. All areas should check within 0.02
acres.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–14</b> Platting Procedures: The lines of the
survey are shown heavier than those of former
surveys so that the locations of the survey will
stand out.</p>

<p class='c003'>All corners recovered or set are shown with a
circle to distinguish them from corners not
found.</p>

<p class='c003'>The lode line is shown as a broken line and if
parallel to the side lines, only the distance each
way from the discovery point is shown; if not
parallel, then the bearing must also be shown.
The bearings and total distances of the lines of
the survey are shown heavier than those of
conflicting surveys and intersections along
such lines.</p>

<p class='c003'>The names of the locations of the survey shall
be shown in vertical capital letters and be larger
and heavier than those of conflicting surveys,
which shall be shown in upper and lower case.</p>

<p class='c003'>Distances to intersections along the line of
survey should be shown before the intersection.
Intersections with lines of prior surveys are
given preference over topographic items. Where
space will not permit the showing of a distance,
it may be placed above a prior distance, with the
first distance shown next to the line.</p>

<p class='c003'>Bearings of conflicting surveys are usually
shown in the direction of the line between
corners as surveyed; i.e., from corner 1 to corner
2, etc. Bearings and distances in all cases should
be shown along the line they pertain to.
Bearings of ties should be shown in the direction
from the corner from which the tie was made.
Ties will be shown with light broken lines. If
there is not room to place the bearing and
distance next to the line, it may be placed on an
arrow.</p>

<p class='c003'>All bearings and distances shall be in slant
lettering. Witness corners are shown with a
circle and labeled W.C. Cor. No.——, provided
they are on a line of the survey. If not on line
they are shown with a tie.</p>

<p class='c003'>Surveyed section lines and surveyed subdivision
of section lines are shown by solid lines;
unsurveyed lines are shown with a broken line.</p>

<p class='c003'>Designation of subdivisions, Township and
Range should be vertical letters. The discovery
workings and all other improvements are
labeled; they may be numbered to agree with the
field notes. It is not necessary to give a tie to the
improvements, except a common improvement
tunnel, shaft, etc.</p>

<p class='c003'>The title block shown on the specimen plat in
the Manual of Surveying Instructions should be
closely followed. While the plat scale is usually
200 feet to an inch, it may be smaller to
accommodate several claims, provided the
necessary data can be shown. Where more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>one sheet is necessary, only the final sheet need
have a title block. All sheets should carry the
survey number and state that it is sheet No.
—— of —— sheets.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the plat is finished it should be
compared with the field notes. This can be done
by two people, one reading the notes and the
other following the plat; or two people can
independently do the comparing. If rough draft
notes were submitted by the mineral surveyor,
they should be returned to him with the
corrections for final typing, and execution of the
“Certificate of Surveyor,” current Form 3860–7.</p>

<p class='c003'>The final typing will consist of the original set
on current Form 9180–21, which is bound on the
left, with two carbon copies on current Form
9180–22, which is bound at the top; this may
vary with state office practice. (Xerox or similar
copies are not acceptable.)</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–15</b> Approval of Survey: The lower portion
of current Form 3860–7, “Certificate of
Surveyor,” contains the certificate of approval
to be signed by an officer of the Bureau of Land
Management. This may be the State Director or
he may delegate this authority to the Chief,
Division or Branch of Cadastral Surveys, for
that state. He should also sign the certificate of
transcript for the two carbon copies.</p>

<p class='c003'>Current Form 3860–8, certifying $500 expenditure,
must also be executed by the above
authorized officer and attached to the copy of
the field notes that will be filed with the
application for patent. If $500 has not been
expended, it is the claimant’s responsibility to
complete the work and have the certificate
executed and filed with the BLM Branch of
Land and Minerals (land office) prior to the
expiration of the period of publication.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the survey has been properly executed and
shows the facts, the State Director cannot refuse
to approve the survey because he feels that the
claim is invalid. (See 57 I.D. 63, Raymond E.
Johnson, 1939.)</p>

<p class='c003'>The original field notes and plat are then
placed in the open files of the Bureau of Land
Management. The location certificates are to be
included with the notes. The two transcripts of
the field notes together with two cloth backed
copies, one of which has been waterproofed for
posting, and a plain paper copy of the plat, will
then be furnished the claimant. An additional
copy for posting will be furnished if a mill site is
included in the survey.</p>

<p class='c003'>One set of the notes and one copy of the plat
will be used to support the application for
patent. Current Form 3860–4, is used to notify
the State Branch of Land and Minerals and the
Director, Bureau of Land Management, of the
approval of the survey and includes a sketch of
the survey. This form is also used to notify the
Regional Forester if the survey is on a National
Forest.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mineral surveyor should be notified by
letter of the approval of the survey and he
should be furnished a paper copy of the plat and
requested to examine it at his early convenience.
(See appendix for copies of forms.)</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Departures from the Normal Procedure</h3>

<p class='c012'><b>5–16</b> Cancellation of Surveys: A patented
mineral survey may never be cancelled. An
unpatented mineral survey may be cancelled
only after the claim has been declared null and
void or relinquished by the claimant; then it
need not be cancelled until it is necessary to do
so to accommodate an entry or administrative
action. It can be cancelled only by the officer of
the Bureau of Land Management authorized to
approve mineral surveys.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the past, claims could be declared null and
void only after a successful contest had been
brought against the claim. After October 21,
1979, claims must be recorded with the Bureau
of Land Management within 90 days of the
location date or they will automatically be
deemed to have been abandoned and void.</p>

<p class='c003'>The procedure is as follows: When the Chief,
Branch of Cadastral Surveys of the State Office
is notified that a claim has been declared null
and void, a notation to that effect should be
made on the plat of survey (or if the plat is in the
archives, it may be made on the card index). No
further action is necessary at this time; the
survey is not cancelled.</p>

<p class='c003'>Cancellation becomes necessary if an entry or
administrative action, including a survey or
resurvey, involves the land embraced in the
mineral survey. Current Form 3860–4, Approval
of Mineral Survey, may be used to cancel the
survey and to notify the Director of the Bureau
of Land Management and any other interested
parties substituting the word “cancelled” or
“cancellation” for approval or it may be by
memorandum.</p>

<p class='c003'>Should a supplemental plat be required to lot
the area embraced in the survey, a certified set of
the field notes of the survey and the mineral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>survey plat should accompany the plat to
Washington, as they do not have the field notes
of unpatented mineral surveys. The field notes
of the cancelled survey becomes the basis for the
new lot designation. The Director’s memoranda
of July 14, 1958 and November 17, 1960, cover
the subject.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–17</b> Unapproved Survey: Occasionally an
order for survey will be cancelled and it is not
known how far the mineral surveyor has
proceeded with the field work and what corners
have been set and marked. In no case should the
corners be removed as they still serve as corners
of the location which may be perfectly valid. The
survey number should not be re-used inasmuch
as it will serve to identify the corners on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–18</b> Additional Notes and Certificate on
Plat: In the past, additional notes were
sometimes prepared from the existing record
along with amendment to the plat in red ink and
accompanying certificate when there was an
omission of a conflict with an agricultural or
other patent, a pending entry or an adverse
claim.</p>

<p class='c003'>For example: A survey was approved without
showing the conflict with a legal subdivision
that had been included in a preemption
homestead. The subdivision was protracted on
the mineral survey plat from the township
survey, based on the section corner tie given in
the mineral survey, intersections given with the
boundaries of the subdivision, and an area of
conflict calculated. All plats were recalled for
the amendment. The additional notes were
written, in triplicate, by the cadastral surveyor,
to show only the lines of the mineral survey
involved in the conflict, giving the intersections.
The area statement was rewritten to the extent
necessary to show the area of conflict.</p>

<p class='c003'>The same procedure was followed if an
adverse claim was to be excluded on the basis of
the description in its location certificate. Red ink
was used on the plats to distinguish the
amendment, but black ink was used if the
certificate specifically stated the extent of the
amendment.</p>

<p class='c003'>Most offices now resolve the above situations
solely through a memorandum process.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–19</b> Amended Surveys and Amended
Plats: This is occasioned by an error in the
original survey that is not discovered until after
the survey is approved, or for the same reasons
listed in 5–18 above, where the amendment
cannot be made from the existing record and
additional field work is required. The claimant
may also request an amended survey. The
claimant bears the cost. Example: In Survey No.
19202A-Am. Colorado, the wrong claim was
included in the survey. The correct claim was
included in the amended survey which covered
the same ground.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–20</b> A new survey is required if the claim
boundaries are changed by amendment after
the original survey is approved. Section 10–62,
page 226 of the Manual of Surveying Instructions
states: “An amended survey must be made
in strict conformity with, or be embraced within
the lines of the original survey.” A new survey is
also required where the claim has been abandoned
and relocated by another.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–21</b> Expenditure of $500 After the Survey is
Approved: Supplemental notes based on a
supplemental order for survey, either to the
original mineral surveyor or another mineral
surveyor, must be submitted and attached to the
original field notes. The supplemental notes
must contain a full description of all improvements.
If the additional expenditure
applies only to one claim of a group, only the
expenditures of that claim need to be recited.
Current Form 3860–8, Certificate of Expenditures,
must be executed and attached to the
claimant’s copy of the notes for filing with the
patent application.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–22</b> If patent is applied for long after the
survey was approved, a statement from the
Chief, Branch of Cadastral Survey, will be
required by the Branch of Land and Minerals to
the effect that the plat correctly shows all
conflicts, or listing the later surveys with which
a conflict exists.</p>

<p class='c003'>If later surveys did not exclude the survey in
question, the plat will be returned by the Branch
of Land and Minerals for amendment, and
amended notes will have to be written. If the
applicant is not the same as the claimant shown
at the time of the survey, he is entitled to use the
survey provided he can show a chain of title. If
he does not have the necessary plats and notes,
the Branch of Cadastral Survey will supply him
with the necessary copies. The claimant bears
all costs.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–23</b> Occasions have arisen where a claim or
survey excluded from the patent is later abandoned.
A supplemental application for patent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>may be made for the excluded ground. The
procedure to be followed is the same as given in
5–22 above. Copies of the plats, including those
for posting and the notes must be furnished the
applicant.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>5–24</b> Patent Applied for in Two
Parts: When only a part of the claims of a
survey are applied for and patented, and later
application for patent is made for the remaining
claims, a copy of the plat, or if the plat is in more
than one sheet, the sheets showing the claim,
must be posted, and a copy, together with a
transcript of that portion of the field notes
pertaining to the claims, filed with the Branch
of Lands and Minerals at the time the
supplemental application for patent is made. If
not all sheets of the plat are used, be sure that
the ones used show all ties and pertinent
information.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h2 class='c010'><span class='large'>CHAPTER VI</span><br /> Resurveys</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><b>6–1</b> Restoration of Lost Corners: <span class='under'>There is no
hard and fast rule for establishing missing
corners of mining claims. The method should be
selected that will give the best results, bearing in
mind that end lines should remain substantially
parallel.</span> Ordinarily, the mineral surveyor
should not remonument a restored corner; at
least, it should not be done without the full
knowledge and approval of the owner. A
cadastral surveyor may remonument a corner if
it is necessary to delineate the boundary
between public and private land. As with all lost
corners, the corner of a mineral survey should be
reestablished from the best available evidence
and in such a configuration that will place the
lines as nearly as possible to their original
position. The ties to bearing trees and objects
should be used first. In fact, if such accessories
are present the corner is not lost.</p>

<p class='c003'>Second in order of preference is the use of
short ties to or from adjoining surveys. A word
of caution in using other mineral survey ties: In
Colorado, and presumably in other states, there
was a period where the short ties to conflicting
surveys were calculated through the section
corner tie. Such calculated ties should not be
used. This period is not exactly known, but it ran
approximately from 1898 to April 28, 1904. If a
report of other surveys was contained in the
field notes, the ties were not calculated. At the
end of this period, it can be determined if
calculations were used. It is not so easy to
distinguish between the methods of survey at
the beginning of the period since it was not
customary to report on other surveys. In any
event, the short tie should not be used unless the
corner tied to (or from) is recovered. If no corners
can be found, the section corner tie may be used,
but it is the tie of last resort. In such cases, all
lines are shown as approved.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Figure 7, several conditions are illustrated.
In situation A, only one corner is recovered, no
other corners or accessories can be found nor are
there any short ties available. In the absence of
further collateral evidence, the three missing
corners must be reestablished at record bearings
and distances from the recovered Corner No. 1.</p>

<p class='c003'>In situation B, Corners Nos. 1 and 2 can be
recovered. Lines 4–1 and 2–3 should be shown at
the record distance, regardless of the length of
line 1–2. The bearings of lines 4–1 and 2–3 may
be the record bearing or at the same variation
from the record as line 1–2. If this was a
rectangular claim, then the bearing of the
missing lines probably should be at right angles
to line 1–2, unless this would give a distorted
relationship between the claim and the
workings on it, particularly the discovery. Line
3–4 should be shown parallel and of equal length
to line 1–2.</p>

<p class='c003'>In situation C, Corners Nos. 1 and 4 are
recovered. Line 2–3 should be shown parallel
and of equal length to line 4–1, if the record was
such. Lines 1–2 and 3–4 should be shown at the
record distance, and at the record bearing or
with the same variance found for line 4–1.</p>

<p class='c003'>In situation D two corners are again
recovered, but they are opposite corners, Nos. 1
and 3. Missing Corner Nos. 2 and 4 can be
restored by using the Grant Boundary method.
See Section 5–44 of the Manual of Surveying
Instructions. They can also be shown at the
record bearing and distance from Cors. Nos. 1
and 3, using either the end lines or side lines,
with the resulting missing lines being the
bearing and distance required to close. The
method selected should restore the lines in the
best relative position to the workings.</p>

<p class='c003'>In situation E, three corners, 1, 2 and 4, are
recovered. Line 2–3 is shown parallel and of
equal length to line 4–1. Line 3–4 is shown
parallel and of equal length to Line 1–2.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>FIG. 7</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>In restoring corners of irregular claims, such
as metes and bounds placers, the broken
boundary (non-riparian) or the Grant Boundary
method should be used. It may also be applied to
lode claims if the above methods do not give
adequate results.</p>

<p class='c003'>In reestablishing corners of a block of claims,
the rules of proportionate measurement may be
applied. In Figure 8, missing Corner No. 2 of
claims E, F, G and H can be restored by double
proportion. Missing Corner No. 1 of claims A
and B may also be restored by double proportion;
since there is no corner beyond this corner,
the record distance from Corner No. 2 would
have to be used in this direction. Corner No. 1
might also be established at the record bearing
and distance from Corner No. 2, or lines 1–2 of
claims A and B could be made parallel and of
equal length to line 3–4 of claim A. Since
missing Corner No. 3 of claims B and D is on an
end line, single proportionate measurement
might be considered. See the Manual of Surveying
Instructions for proportionate methods, pp.
134–136.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>6–2</b> Township Resurveys with Mineral Surveys:
Prior to field work, all unpatented
mineral surveys embracing claims that have
been declared null and void should be cancelled,
leaving only valid existing claims and patents
to be segregated. Restoration of missing corners
should only be made where they are necessary to
control the boundaries between private and
public land, including the boundaries between
public land and unpatented valid mineral
surveys. Segregation surveys of unsurveyed
mining claims may be requested to accommodate
administrative actions. If possible, the
owners of the mining claims should be advised
of the resurvey and given an opportunity to
express their opinions as to the position of
missing corners.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>6–3</b> Mineral Segregation Surveys: Sections
7–39 to 7–44 inclusive, of the Manual of
Surveying Instructions adequately covers this
subject. Segregation surveys are not undertaken
unless there is a need for them arising from
administrative action involving the adjoining
land. Very often it will be necessary to make the
survey within the boundaries as they are
marked on the ground due to inaccuracies in the
location survey. The early township surveys in
California often segregated unsurveyed mining
claims showing them on the township plats
without supporting field notes. Resurveys of
such segregations may be required based on the
evidence found in the field.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>6–4</b> Supplemental Plats: When supplemental
plats are required segregating mineral
surveys, all such surveys must be segregated.
Again, it is desirable that mineral surveys
embracing invalid claims be cancelled. The
need to lot a cancelled mineral survey will also
require a supplemental plat.</p>

<p class='c003'><b>6–5</b> Correcting Errors in Patented Mineral
Surveys: As a general rule, the record of a
patented mineral survey should not be changed
or amended. When such errors are discovered, a
pencil notation on the index card and/or on the
field notes may be appropriate. Reported errors
generally stand on their own merit and are
contained in the field notes of the reporting
survey.</p>
